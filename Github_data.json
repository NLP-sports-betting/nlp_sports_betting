Takes all team data from the 2007-08 season to current season, matched with odds of those games, using a neural network to predict winning bets for today's games. Achieves ~75% accuracy on money lines and ~58% on under/overs. Outputs expected value for teams money lines to provide better insight. The fraction of your bankroll to bet based on the Kelly Criterion is also outputted. Note that a popular, less risky approach is to bet 50% of the stake recommended by the Kelly Criterion.\n## Packages Used\n\nUse Python 3.8. In particular the packages/libraries used are...\n\n* Tensorflow - Machine learning library\n* XGBoost - Gradient boosting framework\n* Numpy - Package for scientific computing in Python\n* Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis\n* Colorama - Color text output\n* Tqdm - Progress bars\n* Requests - Http library\n* Scikit_learn - Machine learning library\n\n## Usage\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting/blob/master/Screenshots/Expected_value.png\" width=\"1010\" height=\"424\" />\n\nMake sure all packages above are installed.\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting.git\n$ cd NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting\n$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n$ python3 main.py -xgb -odds=fanduel\n```\n\nOdds data will be automatically fetched from sbrodds if the -odds option is provided with a sportsbook.  Options include: fanduel, draftkings, betmgm, pointsbet, caesars, wynn, bet_rivers_ny\n\nIf `-odds` is not given, enter the under/over and odds for today's games manually after starting the script.\n\nOptionally, you can add '-kc' as a command line argument to see the recommended fraction of your bankroll to wager based on the model's edge\n\n## Flask Web App\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting/blob/master/Screenshots/Flask-App.png\" width=\"922\" height=\"580\" />\n\nThis repo also includes a small Flask application to help view the data from this tool in the browser.

Par exemple, si l'on veut uniquement se concentrer sur les matches de Ligue 1 Fran\u00e7aise, et que l'on veut seulement parier sur Betclic et Winamax, on \u00e9crira :\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"ligue 1 france\", \"football\", \"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nOn notera que si vous ne pr\u00e9cisez pas de bookmaker, l'algorithme r\u00e9cup\u00e8rera les cotes des matches de la comp\u00e9tition sur la plupart des bookmakers agr\u00e9\u00e9s par l'ARJEL.\nSi vous n'avez pas de comp\u00e9tition ou de sport cible, il est conseill\u00e9 d'appeler\n```python\n>>> parse_football()\n```\nou, par exemple,\n```python\n>>> parse_football(\"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nCes fonctions vont r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les cotes des matches disponibles chez les diff\u00e9rents bookmakers pour les 5 grands championnats europ\u00e9ens de football (Ligue 1, Premier League, LaLiga, Serie A, Bundesliga), car ce sont ces comp\u00e9titions qui, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, g\u00e9n\u00e9rent le plus de rendement.\nOn pr\u00e9cisera que dans le cas du tennis o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de comp\u00e9tition fixe, il faut appeler la fonction:\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis()\n```\nou, par exemple,\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis(\"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nCette commande aura pour effet de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les cotes de matches de tennis des comp\u00e9titions actuellement disput\u00e9es.\n\nVous trouverez ci-dessous un tableau r\u00e9capitulatif des diff\u00e9rents bookmakers agr\u00e9\u00e9s par l'ARJEL avec la cha\u00eene de caract\u00e8res associ\u00e9e dans le package.\n\n| Bookmaker  | Cha\u00eene de caract\u00e8res |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| [Betclic](https://www.betclic.fr/sport/)  | `\"betclic\"`  |\n| [Bwin](https://sports.bwin.fr/fr/sports)  | `\"bwin\"`  |\n| [France Pari](https://www.france-pari.fr/)  | `\"france_pari\"`  |\n| [JOA](https://www.joa-online.fr/fr/sport)  | `\"joa\"` |\n| [NetBet](https://www.netbet.fr/)  | `\"netbet\"` |\n| [Parions Sport](https://www.enligne.parionssport.fdj.fr/) |`\"parionssport\"` |\n| [PasinoBet](https://www.pasinobet.fr/) |`\"pasinobet\"` |\n| [PMU](https://paris-sportifs.pmu.fr/) |`\"pmu\"` |\n| [PokerStars](https://www.pokestarssport.fr/)  | `\"pokerstars\"`  |\n| [Unibet](https://www.unibet.fr/sport) |`\"unibet\"` |\n| [Winamax](https://www.winamax.fr/paris-sportifs/sports/) |`\"winamax\"` |\n| [Zebet](https://www.zebet.fr/fr/) |`\"zebet\"` |\n\n*Nota bene*: Il n'est pour l'instant pas possible d'utiliser le package pour les bookmakers suivant :\n- [Feelingbet](https://feelingbet.fr/) qui propose tr\u00e8s peu de promotions. Mais au besoin, les cotes disponibles sur ce site sont identiques \u00e0 celles disponibles sur [France Pari](https://www.france-pari.fr/)\n- [Genybet](https://sport.genybet.fr/) qui est davantage ax\u00e9 sur les paris hippiques plut\u00f4t que sportifs\n- [Vbet](https://www.vbet.fr/paris-sportifs) qui propose des promotions nombreuses mais tr\u00e8s restrictives et donc peu rentables\n\nLa r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des cotes peut \u00eatre facilement utilis\u00e9e depuis l'interface sur l'onglet \"R\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des cotes\". Il suffit alors de choisir le sport, le (ou les) championnat(s) et le (ou les) bookmaker(s) souhait\u00e9s. Une barre de chargement appara\u00eet alors, la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des cotes est termin\u00e9e lorsque la barre dispara\u00eet.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82161583-5534cd80-989e-11ea-928d-c94c821cd873.png)\n\n\u00c0 titre informatif, toutes les cotes r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9es sont consultables depuis l'onglet \"Cotes\" de l'interface. Dans cet onglet vous pouvez ainsi facilement comparer les cotes d'un m\u00eame match entre les diff\u00e9rents bookmakers. Vous avez \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 de supprimer un match que vous ne souhaitez pas prendre en compte dans les calculs futurs.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82209315-5e10b800-990d-11ea-9b5a-db1065d316eb.png)\n\n## Exemples d'utilisation\n\nLes bonus re\u00e7us sont quasi syst\u00e9matiquement des freebets (ou paris gratuits). Un tel bonus signifie que lorsque l'on mise, par exemple, sur une cote \u00e0 3 avec un freebet de 10\u20ac, si le pari s'av\u00e8re gagnant, alors on r\u00e9cup\u00e8re 3\u00d710-10 = 20\u20ac (contre 30\u20ac pour un pari standard), cela \u00e9quivaut donc \u00e0 miser avec un pari normal sur une cote r\u00e9duite de 1.\nOn verra plus tard qu'il est possible de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer de mani\u00e8re certaine, 80% de la valeur d'un freebet. Ainsi, un freebet de 10\u20ac \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 10 \u00d7 0.8 = 8\u20ac.\n\nLes exemples ci-dessous sont des exemples de promotions qui reviennent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement chez les diff\u00e9rents bookmakers. Vous y trouverez une description de comment exploiter au mieux ces promotions. Bien-s\u00fbr, cette liste n'est pas exhaustive et il vous appartient d'adapter ces exemples aux conditions des promotions que vous rencontrerez \u00e0 l'avenir.\nPour chacun des exemples, vous trouverez une explication de comment rentabiliser une promotion similaire en ligne de commande ou \u00e0 l'aide de l'interface.\n\n### Exemple 1 : Bonus re\u00e7u dans tous les cas si l'on mise sur un match donn\u00e9\nFrance-pari propose tr\u00e8s souvent une promotion qui consiste \u00e0 miser un pari de 20\u20ac sur un match pr\u00e9cis de Ligue 1 \u00e0 une cote minimale de 2 pour recevoir un freebet de 5\u20ac.\nPar exemple, pour la 20e journ\u00e9e de Ligue 1 2019/2020, le match propos\u00e9 \u00e9tait Toulouse - Brest.\nIl suffit alors d'ex\u00e9cuter:\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"ligue 1\", \"football\") #Si non ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment\n>>> best_stakes_match(\"Toulouse - Brest\", \"france_pari\", 20, 2, \"football\")\n```\nSi la plus-value minimum est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 5 \u00d7 0.8 = 4\u20ac, alors cette promotion est rentable et on peut r\u00e9partir nos mises telles qu'elles sont d\u00e9crites.\n\nPour effectuer ce calcul depuis l'interface, il suffit de vous rendre sur l'onglet \"Pari sur un match donn\u00e9\" et de s\u00e9lectionner les param\u00e8tres souhait\u00e9s.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82214782-a1bbef80-9916-11ea-8c4e-62f8187a09b5.png)\n\n### Exemple 2 : Bonus re\u00e7u dans tous les cas si l'on mise sur un match quelconque, \u00e9ventuellement d'une comp\u00e9tition donn\u00e9e / d'un sport donn\u00e9\nS'il n'y a aucune condition sur le match \u00e0 jouer, on peut \u00e9x\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> parse_football()\n```\ncar, comme dit plus haut, ce sont ces matches qui vont g\u00e9n\u00e9rer le plus de rendement.\n\nSi on doit miser sur un match de NBA, on peut ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")\n```\n\nSi on doit miser sur un match de tennis, on peut ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis()\n```\n\nOn notera par ailleurs qu'il n'est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pas possible de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les cotes de tous les matches d'un sport donn\u00e9, car cela peu \u00eatre tr\u00e8s couteux en temps d'ex\u00e9cution. Il faut donc choisir la ou les comp\u00e9tition(s) la (les) plus populaire(s) pour le sport choisi, car ce sont ces matches qui g\u00e9n\u00e8reront le plus de rendement.\nLe tableau ci-dessous indique quelle fonction appeler pour chaque sport.\n\n\n\n| Sport  | Fonction \u00e0 appeler |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Football  | `parse_football()`  |\n| Basketball  | `parse_nba()` (raccourci de `parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")`)|\n| Tennis  | `parse_tennis()`  |\n| Rugby  | `parse_competitions([\"top 14\", \"champions cup\", \"six nations\"], \"rugby\")`  |\n| Hockey sur glace  | `parse_nhl()`  (raccourci de `parse_competition(\"nhl\", \"hockey-sur-glace\")`)  |\n\nUne fois votre ensemble de matches choisi, on peut alors utiliser la fonction `best_match_under_conditions`\n\nPar exemple, France-pari propose r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement une promotion qui consiste \u00e0 rembourser, en freebet, 10% des mises engag\u00e9es sur des cotes sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1,70 et dans une limite de 100\u20ac rembours\u00e9s. L'objectif est alors de miser 1000\u20ac afin de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le bonus maximal. Ainsi, si l'on suppose que la promotion se d\u00e9roule entre le 3 janvier 2020 \u00e0 minuit et le 12 janvier 2020 \u00e0 23h59, on peut ex\u00e9cuter :\n```python\n>>> best_match_under_conditions(\"france_pari\", 1.7, 1000, \"football\", \"3/1/2020\", \"0h00\", \"12/1/2020\", \"23h59\")\n```\nSi la perte affich\u00e9e est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100 \u00d7 0.8 = 80\u20ac, alors cette promotion est rentable et on peut r\u00e9partir nos mises telles qu'elles sont d\u00e9crites.\n\nDepuis l'interface, cela revient \u00e0 se rendre sur l'onglet \"Pari simple\" et rentrer les param\u00e8tres ad\u00e9quats.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82214951-e21b6d80-9916-11ea-8c95-2c3daf1a5b03.png)\n\n\n### Exemple 3 : Bonus re\u00e7u si au moins *n* matches gagn\u00e9s\n*Nota bene*: \u00c0 partir de cet exemple, on supposera que l'on a pr\u00e9alablement appel\u00e9 une fonction d'initialisation des matches voulus (du type `parse_...`), en fonction des besoins de la promotion.\n\nParfois, il est n\u00e9cessaire de gagner un certain nombre de paris pour recevoir un bonus. Dans ces cas-l\u00e0, il faut miser sur le m\u00eame bookmaker sur chacune des issues d'un m\u00eame match. Betclic propose par exemple parfois de recevoir 10\u20ac de freebet pour 3 paris gagn\u00e9s, de 5\u20ac chacun, mis\u00e9s sur des cotes d'au moins 1.7 et plac\u00e9s sur 3 matches diff\u00e9rents. On peut alors ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> best_match_pari_gagnant(\"betclic\", 1.7, 5, \"tennis\")\n```\nCette fonction donnera le meilleur match sur lequel parier \u00e0 un instant donn\u00e9. Si la perte affich\u00e9e est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 (10 \u00d7 0.8)/3, alors on peut supposer que cette promotion est rentable et on peut r\u00e9partir nos mises telles qu'elles sont d\u00e9crites. Cela constituera le premier pari gagnant. Un peu plus tard (par exemple lorsque le match en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 jou\u00e9), on peut r\u00e9it\u00e9rer ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 afin de savoir sur quel match doit on jouer pour gagner le 2\u00e8me pari de la s\u00e9rie et ainsi de suite jusqu'\u00e0 atteindre 3 paris gagnants. \u00c0 noter, que dans ce cas pr\u00e9cis, il est n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9-ex\u00e9cuter la fonction `parse_tennis` une fois qu'on a gagn\u00e9 un pari, car dans le cas contraire, le r\u00e9sultat renvoy\u00e9 par la fonction `best_match_pari_gagnant` serait identique au r\u00e9sultat de l'ex\u00e9cution pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n\nDepuis l'interface, il vous suffit de vous rendre sur l'onglet \"Pari gagnant\" et de rentrer les param\u00e8tres voulus.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82216530-5a832e00-9919-11ea-9e62-5e0eeb10fe3d.png)\n\nUne fois le pari plac\u00e9, vous avez la possibilit\u00e9 de supprimer le match obtenu de la base de donn\u00e9es depuis l'onglet \"Cotes\".\nDe cette mani\u00e8re, vous obtienez un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent lorsque vous r\u00e9ex\u00e9cutez le calcul depuis l'onglet \"Pari gagnant\".\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82234278-7bf01400-9931-11ea-836b-e0a53a31deb6.png)\n\n\n### Exemple 4 : Bonus re\u00e7u si un pari est perdant.\nIl s'agit d'un type de promotion tr\u00e8s courant, notamment en ce qui concerne les offres de bienvenue, mais pas seulement.\nPar exemple, \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2018, Winamax proposait \u00e0 ses utilisateurs de rembourser en cash (donc pas en freebet) 100% leur premier pari de 200\u20ac maximum si celui-ci est perdant. On notera par ailleurs que sur Winamax (comme sur la plupart des autres bookmakers), on ne peut parier que sur des cotes sup\u00e9rieures (ou \u00e9gales) \u00e0 1.10. On peut alors ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> best_match_cashback(\"winamax\", 1.1, 200, \"football\", freebet=False)\n```\n\nCe calcul est \u00e9galement accessible depuis l'interface, dans l'onglet \"Cashback\".\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82234484-c6719080-9931-11ea-8357-191bd9f58a78.png)\n\n\n## Conversion des freebets en cash\n### M\u00e9thode 1 : Si l'on n'a que des freebets fractionnables\nChez les bookmakers suivant : Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport et Zebet, il est possible de fractionner les freebets gagn\u00e9s en plusieurs paris. Par exemple, si l'on a gagn\u00e9 10\u20ac de freebets, il est possible de miser 8\u20ac puis 2\u20ac.\nPour optimiser le gain, l'id\u00e9e va alors \u00eatre de couvrir toutes les issues avec des freebets sur un combin\u00e9 de 2 matches de football (ce qui repr\u00e9sente donc 9 issues \u00e0 couvrir).\nPar exemple, si on dispose de 10\u20ac de freebet, on va alors ex\u00e9cuter\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet_one_site(\"betclic\", 10)\n```\n\n\n\n### M\u00e9thode 2 : Si l'on a quelques freebets non fractionnables et suffisamment de freebets fractionnables\nChez tous les bookmakers sauf Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport et Zebet, il n'est pas possible de s\u00e9parer un freebet en plusieurs paris. \nSupposons que l'on dispose de 100\u20ac de freebets fractionnables sur Betclic, 1 freebet de 10\u20ac sur Winamax et 2 freebets de 5\u20ac sur France-pari. \nL'id\u00e9e serait alors de r\u00e9partir nos 100\u20ac de freebets fractionnables sur un combin\u00e9 de 2 matches comme dans la m\u00e9thode 1, puis de remplacer (totalement ou en partie) certaines mises par des freebets non fractionnables des autres bookmakers. De cette mani\u00e8re on r\u00e9partit les freebets non fractionnables sur plusieurs issues d'un combin\u00e9 et on comble les diff\u00e9rences avec des freebets fractionnables. On aura donc vraisemblablement des issues couvertes uniquement par un freebet non fractionnable, d'autres couvertes en partie par un freebet non fractionnable et un freebet fractionnable, et d'autres couvertes uniquement en freebet fractionnable. Dans cet exemple, on ex\u00e9cute alors\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet([\"betclic\"], [[10, \"winamax\"], [5, \"france_pari\"], [5, \"france_pari\"]])\n```\n\nDepuis l'interface, l'onglet \"Freebets \u00e0 placer\" effectue le m\u00eame calcul, on obtient alors:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82235094-924a9f80-9932-11ea-95d9-e6c49d25fc00.png)\n\n\nCette deuxi\u00e8me m\u00e9thode doit, lorsqu'elle est possible, \u00eatre celle \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier lorsque l'on dispose de freebets non fractionnables car c'est elle qui offre le meilleur rendement. La premi\u00e8re m\u00e9thode est elle aussi tr\u00e8s rentable mais il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de conserver les freebets fractionnables pour justement appliquer la 2e m\u00e9thode lorsque l'on disposera de freebets non fractionnables.\n\n\n\n### M\u00e9thode 3 : Si l'on dispose de freebets non fractionnables et pas assez de freebets fractionnables\nPar ailleurs, chez tous les bookmakers sauf Betclic, Unibet et Zebet, les freebets ont une date limite d'utilisation, allant de 2-3 jours pour Bwin, \u00e0 1 mois pour France-pari. Il peut donc \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de les jouer rapidement et il se peut \u00e9galement que l'on n'ait pas assez de freebets fractionnables pour pouvoir appliquer la 2e m\u00e9thode. Dans cette situation, il est plus efficace de parier sur un unique match plut\u00f4t que sur un combin\u00e9. Il est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire de couvrir un pari en freebet avec de l'argent r\u00e9el. De plus, avec cette m\u00e9thode, on ne peut jouer qu'un freebet \u00e0 la fois. Ainsi si l'on dispose d'un freebet de 15\u20ac chez Betstars, on ex\u00e9cute alors\n```python\n>>> best_match_freebet(\"betstars\", 15, \"football\")\n```\n*Nota bene* : Ne pas confondre `best_match_freebet` et `best_matches_freebet`.\n\nOn notera par ailleurs que certains sites comme NetBet ou PMU proposent parfois des freebets qui ne sont jouables que sur un unique sport. Auquel cas, il faut adapter le sport \u00e0 la situation.\n\n\nOn peut appliquer cette m\u00e9thode depuis l'interface dans l'onglet \"Freebet unique\".\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43851883/82234834-3122cc00-9932-11ea-8709-6dec63176058.png)\n\n\n\nCette m\u00e9thode est en moyenne beaucoup moins rentable et beaucoup plus volatile que les deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Les deux premi\u00e8res m\u00e9thodes assurent un taux de revient situ\u00e9 entre 77 et 85% de la somme de freebets engag\u00e9s. Avec la 3\u00e8me m\u00e9thode, il faut s'attendre \u00e0 un taux de revient situ\u00e9 entre 55 et 70%.\n\n\n## Avertissement\nCe projet a pour but d'aider l'utilisateur \u00e0 d\u00e9gager de l'argent en se rapprochant au maximum de l'absence de risque. N\u00e9anmoins, il est important de pr\u00e9ciser que le risque z\u00e9ro n'existe pas et que les cotes publi\u00e9es par les bookmakers sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00e9voluer au cours du temps.

For example, if you only want to focus on French Ligue 1 matches, and you only want to bet on Betclic and Winamax, you would write :\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"ligue 1 france\", \"football\", \"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nNote that if you do not specify a bookmaker, the algorithm will retrieve the odds of the matches of the competition from most of the bookmakers approved by the ARJEL (French Regulatory authority for online games).\nIf you do not have a specific competition or target sport, it is advisable to call\n```python\n>>> parse_football()\n```\nor, for example,\n```python\n>>> parse_football(\"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nThese functions will retrieve the odds of the matches available at the various bookmakers for the 5 major European football championships (Ligue 1, Premier League, LaLiga, Serie A, Bundesliga), as these competitions generally generate the highest returns.\nIt should be pointed out that in the case of tennis where there is no fixed competition, it is necessary to call the function:\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis()\n```\nor, for example,\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis(\"betclic\", \"winamax\")\n```\nThis command will retrieve the odds of tennis matches from the competitions currently being played.\n\nYou will find below a summary table of the different French bookmakers with the associated string in the package.\n\n| Bookmaker | String |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| [Betclic](https://www.betclic.fr/sport/) | ``\"betclic\"\" |\n| [BetStars](https://www.betstars.fr/) | ``betstars\"` |\n| [Bwin](https://sports.bwin.fr/fr/sports) | \"bwin\" |\n| [France Pari](https://www.france-pari.fr/) | `\"france_pari\"` |\n| [JOA](https://www.joa-online.fr/fr/sport) | \"joa\"` |\n| [NetBet](https://www.netbet.fr/) | `\"netbet\"` |\n| [Pariels Sport](https://www.enligne.parionssport.fdj.fr/) |\n| [PasinoBet](https://www.pasinobet.fr/) ||\"pasinobet\"` |\n| [PMU](https://paris-sportifs.pmu.fr/) |\"pmu\"` |\n| [Unibet](https://www.unibet.fr/sport) |\n| [Winamax](https://www.winamax.fr/paris-sportifs/sports/) |\n| [Zebet](https://www.zebet.fr/fr/) |\n\n*Note bene*: It is currently not possible to use the package for the following bookmakers:\n- [Feelingbet](https://feelingbet.fr/) which offers very few promotions. But if necessary, the odds available on this site are identical to those available on [France Pari](https://www.france-pari.fr/).\n- [Genybet](https://sport.genybet.fr/) which focuses more on horse betting rather than sports betting.\n- Vbet](https://www.vbet.fr/paris-sportifs) which offers numerous but very restrictive and therefore unprofitable promotions.\n\n\n## Examples of use\n\nThe bonuses received are almost always freebets (or paris gratuits). Such a bonus means that when you bet, for example, on an odds equals to 3 with a \u20ac10 freebet, if the bet turns out to be winning, then you get 3\u00d710-10 = \u20ac20 (compared to \u20ac30 for a standard bet), so it is equivalent to betting with a normal bet on an odds reduced by 1.\nWe will see later that it is possible to win back 80% of the value of a freebet with certainty. Thus, a \u20ac10 freebet is equivalent to 10 \u00d7 0.8 = \u20ac8.\n\nThe examples below are examples of promotions that regularly appear at the different bookmakers. You will find a description of how to get the most out of these promotions. This list is naturally not exhaustive and it is up to you to adapt these examples to the conditions of the promotions you will encounter in the future.\n### Example 1: Bonus received in all cases if you bet on a given match\nFrance-pari very often offers a promotion which consists in betting a \u20ac20 bet on a specific Ligue 1 match at a minimum odds of 2 to receive a \u20ac5 freebet.\nFor example, for the 20th round of Ligue 1 2019/2020, the proposed match was Dijon - Metz.\nYou just have to execute:\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"ligue 1\", \"football\") #If not previously executed\n>>> best_stakes_match(\"Dijon - Metz\", \"france_pari\", 20, 2, \"football\")\n```\nIf the minimum raise is more than 5 \u00d7 0.8 = \u20ac4, then this promotion is profitable and we can split our bets as specified.\n\n\n### Example 2: Bonus received in all cases if you bet on any match, possibly from a given competition / sport\nIf there are no conditions on the game to be played, we can execute\n```python\n>>> parse_football()\n```\nbecause, as mentioned above, it is these matches that will generate the most returns.\n\nIf we're betting on an NBA game, we can execute...\n```python\n>>> parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")\n```\n\nIf we're going to bet on a tennis match, we can execute\n```python\n>>> parse_tennis()\n```\n\nIt should also be noted that it is generally not possible to retrieve the odds of all the matches of a given sport, as this can be very costly in terms of execution time. It is therefore necessary to choose the most popular competition(s) for the chosen sport, as it is these matches that will generate the most returns.\nThe table below indicates which function to call for each sport.\n\n\n\n| Sport | Function to call |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Football | `parse_football()` |\n| Basketball | `parse_nba()` (short for `parse_competition(\"nba\", \"basketball\")`)|\n| Tennis | `parse_tennis()` |\n| Rugby | `parse_competitions([\"top 14\", \"champions cup\", \"six nations\"], \"rugby\")` |\n| Ice Hockey | `parse_nhl()` (short for `parse_competition(\"nhl\", \"hockey-sur-glace\")`) |\n\nOnce you have chosen your set of matches, you can then use the `best_match_under_conditions` function.\n\nFor example, France-pari regularly offers a promotion which consists in reimbursing, in freebet, 10% of the stakes engaged on odds higher than 1.70 and within a limit of \u20ac100 reimbursed. The objective is then to bet \u20ac1000 in order to recover the maximum bonus. Thus, if we assume that the promotion takes place between January 3, 2020 at midnight and January 12, 2020 at 11:59 pm, we can execute :\n```python\n>>> best_match_under_conditions(\"france_pari\", 1.7, 1000, \"football\", \"3/1/2020\", \"0h00\", \"12/1/2020\", \"23h59\")\n```\nIf the displayed loss is less than 100 \u00d7 0.8 = \u20ac80, then this promotion is profitable and we can distribute our stakes as described.\n\n### Example 3: Bonus received if at least *n* matches are won\nPlease note: From this example, we'll assume that we previously called a function to initialize the desired matches (of the type `parse_...`), according to the needs of the promotion.\n\nSometimes it is necessary to win a certain number of bets to receive a bonus. In these cases, it is necessary to bet on the same bookmaker on each of the outcomes of the same match. For example, Betclic sometimes offers to receive a \u20ac10 freebet for 3 bets won, of \u20ac5 each, bet on odds of at least 1.7 and placed on 3 different matches. You can then execute\n```python\n>>> best_match_pari_gagnant(\"betclic\", 1.7, 5, \"tennis\")\n```\nThis feature will give you the best match to bet on at any given time. If the displayed loss is less than (10 \u00d7 0.8)/3, then we can assume that this promotion is profitable and we can distribute our stakes as described. This will be the first winning bet. A little later (e.g. when the match in question has been played), we can repeat this procedure to find out which match we need to play to win the 2nd bet in the series and so on until we reach 3 winning bets. Note that in this case, it is necessary to re-execute the `parse_tennis` function once you have won a bet, because otherwise the result returned by the `best_match_pari_gagnant` function would be identical to the result of the previous execution.\n\n### Example 4: Bonus received if a bet is lost.\nThis is a very common type of promotion, especially but not only for welcome offers.\nFor example, in the summer of 2018, Winamax offered its users to pay back in cash (not freebet) 100% of their first bet of \u20ac200 maximum if they lost. It should also be noted that on Winamax (as on most other bookmakers), you can only bet on odds greater than (or equal to) 1.10. You can then run\n```python\n>>> best_match_cashback(\"winamax\", 1.1, 200, \"football\", freebet=False)\n```\n\n## Converting freebets to cash\n### Method 1: If you only have fractionable freebets\nAt the following bookmakers: Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport and Zebet, it is possible to split the won freebets into several bets. For example, if you have won \u20ac10 in freebets, you can bet \u20ac8 and then \u20ac2.\nTo optimize the win, the idea will be to cover all the outcomes with freebets on a combination of 2 football matches (which represents 9 outcomes to cover).\nFor example, if you have \u20ac10 of freebet, you will then run\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet_one_site(\"betclic\", 10)\n```\n\n### Method 2: If you have a few non-fractionable freebets and enough fractionable freebets\nAt all bookmakers except Betclic, Unibet, ParionsSport and Zebet, it is not possible to split a freebet into several bets. \nLet's suppose that you have \u20ac100 fractionable freebets on Betclic, 1 freebet of \u20ac10 on Winamax and 2 freebets of \u20ac5 on France-pari. \nThe idea would then be to spread our \u20ac100 of fractionable freebets over a combination of 2 games as in method 1, then replace (totally or partially) some stakes with non-fractionable freebets from other bookmakers. In this way we spread the non-fractionable freebets over several outcomes of a handset and compensate the differences with fractionable freebets. So you are likely to have some outcomes covered only by a non-fractionable freebet, others covered partly by a non-fractionable freebet and a fractionable freebet, and others covered only by a fractionable freebet. In this example, we then execute\n```python\n>>> best_matches_freebet([\"betclic\"], [[10, \"winamax\"], [5, \"france_pari\"], [5, \"france_pari\"])\n```\nThis second method should, where possible, be the preferred method when non-fractionable freebets are available, as it offers the best return. The first method is also very profitable but it is preferable to keep the fractionable freebets in order to apply the second method when you have non-fractionable freebets.\n\n### Method 3: If you have non-fractionable freebets and not enough fractionable freebets\nAt all bookmakers except Betclic, Unibet and Zebet, freebets have a time limit, ranging from 2-3 days for Bwin, to 1 month for France-pari. It may therefore be necessary to bet them quickly and there may not be enough fractionable freebets to be able to apply the 2nd method. In this situation, it is more efficient to bet on a single match rather than on a combination. It is also necessary to cover a freebet with real money. Furthermore, with this method, you can only play one freebet at a time. So if you have a \u20ac15 freebet at Betstars, then you can execute\n```python\n>>> best_match_freebet(\"betstars\", 15, \"football\")\n```\nPlease note: Be careful not to confuse `best_match_freebet` with `best_matches_freebet`.\n\nNote that some sites like NetBet or PMU sometimes offer freebets that are only playable on a single sport. In this case, you have to adapt the sport to the situation.\nThis method is on average much less profitable and much more volatile than the first two. The first two methods ensure a return rate of between 77 and 85% of the sum of freebets placed.  With the third method, a return rate between 55 and 70% is to be expected.\n\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis project aims to help the user to free up money by getting as close as possible to the absence of risk.

It is compatible with [scikit-learn].\n\n### Sports betting in practice\n\nYou can think of any sports betting event as a random experiment with unknown probabilities for the various outcomes. Even for the\nmost unlikely outcome, for example scoring more than 10 goals in a soccer match, a small probability is still assigned. The\nbookmaker estimates this probability P and offers the corresponding odds O. In theory, if the bookmaker offers the so-called fair\nodds O = 1 / P in the long run, neither the bettor nor the bookmaker would make any money.\n \nThe bookmaker's strategy is to adjust the odds in their favor using the over-round of probabilities. In practice, it offers odds\nless than the estimated fair odds. The important point here is that the bookmaker still has to estimate the probabilities of\noutcomes and provide odds that guarantee them long-term profit.\n\nOn the other hand, the bettor can also estimate the probabilities and compare them to the odds the bookmaker offers. If the\nestimated probability of an outcome is higher than the implied probability from the provided odds, then the bet is called a value\nbet.\n\nThe only long-term betting strategy that makes sense is to select value bets. However, you have to remember that neither the\nbettor nor the bookmaker can access the actual probabilities of outcomes. Therefore, identifying a value bet from the side of the\nbettor is still an estimation. The bettor or the bookmaker might be wrong, or both of them.\n\nAnother essential point is that bookmakers can access resources that the typical bettor is rare to access. For instance, they have\nmore data, computational power, and teams of experts working on predictive models. You may assume that trying to beat them is\npointless, but this is not necessarily correct. The bookmakers have multiple factors to consider when they offer their adjusted\nodds. This is the reason there is a considerable variation among the offered odds. The bettor should aim to systematically\nestimate the value bets, backtest their performance, and not create arbitrarily accurate predictive models. This is a realistic\ngoal, and `sports-betting` can help by providing appropriate tools.\n\nUsing `sports-betting` CLI, the betting process includes the following steps:\n\n- Create a dataloader's configuration file that selects the training and fixtures data.\n\n- Create a bettor's configuration file that selects and configures the betting strategy.\n\nYou can find examples of configuration files in `sports-betting/configs`.\n  \nExtract the training data:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader training -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\nExtract the fixtures data:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader fixtures -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\nApply backtesting to estimate the performance of the model on future data:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet bettor backtest -b bettor_config.py -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\nGet the value bets:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet bettor bettor -b bettor_config.py -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nFor user installation, `sports-betting` is currently available on the PyPi's repository, and you can install it via `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install sports-betting\n```\n\nDevelopment installation requires to clone the repository and then use [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to install the\nproject as well as the main and development dependencies:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/georgedouzas/sports-betting.git\ncd sports-betting\npdm install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the Python API or the CLI to access the full functionality of `sports-betting`. Nevertheless, it is recommended to be\nfamiliar with the Python API since it is still needed to write configuration files for the CLI.\n\n### API\n\nThe `sports-betting` package makes it easy to download sports betting data:\n\n```python\nfrom sportsbet.datasets import SoccerDataLoader\ndataloader = SoccerDataLoader(param_grid={'league': ['Italy'], 'year': [2020]})\nX_train, Y_train, O_train = dataloader.extract_train_data(odds_type='market_maximum', drop_na_thres=1.0)\nX_fix, Y_fix, O_fix = dataloader.extract_fixtures_data()\n```\n\n`X_train` are the historical/training data and `X_fix` are the test/fixtures data. The historical data can be used to backtest the\nperformance of a bettor model:\n\n```python\nfrom sportsbet.evaluation import ClassifierBettor\nfrom sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier\nbettor = ClassifierBettor(DummyClassifier())\nbettor.backtest(X_train, Y_train, O_train)\n```\n\nWe can use the trained bettor model to predict the value bets using the fixtures data:\n\n```python\nbettor.bet(X_fix, O_fix)\n```\n\n### CLI\n\nThe command `sportsbet` provides various sub-commands to download data and predict the value bets. For any sub-command you may\nadd the `--help` flag to get more information about its usage.\n\n#### Dataloader\n\nThe sub-command `sportsbet dataloader` requires a dataloader configuration file. You can find examples of such configuration files\nin `sports-betting/configs/dataloaders`. The following conventions apply:\n\n- The configuration file has a Python extension.\n\n- It should include a dictionary called `MAIN` and two key-value pairs. A `'dataloader'` key with a dataloader class as\n  value and a `'path'` key with a relative to the configuration file path as value. It will be the path of the pickled dataloader.\n\n- It may include a dictionary called `OPTIONAL` and up to three key-value pairs. The three keys are `'param_grid'`,\n  `'drop_na_thres'` and `'drop_na'`. You can refer to the [API](api/datasets) for more details about their values.\n\nUsing a dataloader configuration file and the following commands you can extract training and fixtures data.\n\nShow available parameters for dataloaders:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader params -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\nShow available odds types:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader odds-types -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\nExtract training data:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader training -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\nExtract fixtures data:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet dataloader fixtures -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\n#### Bettor\n\nThe sub-command `sportsbet bettor` requires both bettor and dataloader configuration files. The dataloader configuration files are\nexplained above. For the bettor configuration files, you can find examples of such configuration files in\n`sports-betting/configs/bettors`, while the following conventions apply:\n\n- The configuration file has a Python extension.\n\n- It should include a dictionary called `MAIN` and two key-value pairs. A `'bettor'` key with a bettor class as\n  value and a `'path'` key with a relative to the configuration file path as value. It will be the path of the pickled bettor.\n\n- It may include a dictionary called `OPTIONAL` and multiple key-value pairs. Two of the optional keys are `'tscv'` and\n  `'init_cash'` The rest of the keys are the initialization parameters of the selected bettor. You can refer to the\n  [API](api/evaluation) for more details about their values.\n\nUsing a bettor configuration file and the following commands you can backtest the bettor and estimate the value bets.\n\nBacktest the bettor:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet bettor backtest -b bettor_config.py -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n\nGet the value bets:\n\n```bash\nsportsbet bettor bet -b bettor_config.py -d dataloader_config.py\n```\n"

In order to perform this task, the very minimal data required is the historical results and betting odds (closing odds are usually preferred) which you can then use to create Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to infer probabilities of victories, and to analyze whether any given team is being undervalued or overvalued by any given bookmaker. The oddsportal website is one of the largest publicly open odds database, however its format and architecture are not very pleasing to deal with, therefore one need a bit of time to build tools to collect the data on their website. This package offers a comprehensive interface (sort of unofficial API) to collect odds and save the data into a comprehensive csv format. <br />\n\n[1] https://www.oddsportal.com/ <br />\n\nNB : This package is purposed for educational use only, not for any commmercial purpose in any way.

This is apart of the Move 37 course at the [School of AI](http://www.theschool.ai).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone.\n\n## Usage\n\nType python value_iteration.py into terminal and it will run.\n\n## History\n\nThis is an adapted version of the \"Gambler's Problem\" that I've applied to sports betting. Details below\n\n-The Gambler Problem as discussed in Example 4.3 in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.\n-The problem from the book is described below:\n\n**Gambler\u2019s Problem**: A gambler has the opportunity to make bets\non the outcomes of a sequence of coin flips. If the coin comes up heads, he wins as\nmany dollars as he has staked on that flip; if it is tails, he loses his stake. The game\nends when the gambler wins by reaching his goal of $100, or loses by running out of\nmoney. On each flip, the gambler must decide what portion of his capital to stake,\nin integer numbers of dollars. This problem can be formulated as an undiscounted,\nepisodic, finite MDP. The state is the gambler\u2019s capital, s \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , 99} and the\nactions are stakes, a \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , min(s, 100\u2212s)}. The reward is zero on all transitions\nexcept those on which the gambler reaches his goal, when it is +1. The state-value\nfunction then gives the probability of winning from each state. A policy is a mapping\nfrom levels of capital to stakes. The optimal policy maximizes the probability of\nreaching the goal. Let ph denote the probability of the coin coming up heads. If ph\nis known, then the entire problem is known and it can be solved, for instance, by\nvalue iteration\n"

Bet at your own risk.**_\n\nThis program will find arbitrage betting opportunities during live sports events. The program will scrape live data off betting websites every 10 milliseconds, find if an arbitrage exists, calculate the exact wagering amounts needed, and place bets.\n\nThere are three Python programs in this repository.\n\n- The program names start with F & D or F & W. F stands for FanDuel, D stands for DraftKings, and W stands for William Hill.\n- Programs that end with \"Two Person\" are for two person or two team events that include only moneyline bets (such as tennis).\n- Programs that do not end with this phrase are for sports that include over / under bets, moneyline and spread bets (such as baseball).\n- The automated bot only looks for standard bet types.\n\nThe program will first scrape all live event names and odds based on the sport selected in the program. The live event names are matched against each sportsbook in order to compare live odds. Using a Nash equilibrium, the program will find if there are arbitrage betting opportunities. If an arbitrage is found, then the program will select that wager, enter the calculated wager amounts and place the bet.\n\nThe programs use multithreading to make them as fast as possible to find arbitrage opportunities. Also, the programs use the [undetected-chromedriver](https://pypi.org/project/undetected-chromedriver/) package to help avoid bot detection.\n\n**Please note** that most sportsbooks include a bet delay. After a bet is placed, the sportsbook will take several seconds to validate the bet. During this time, one sportsbook may accept your bet, while the other sportsbook may update its odds.\n\n## Troubleshooting Error\n\nIf you run into an error that states `AttributeError: 'ArbFinder' object has no attribute 'driver'` go to `chrome://settings/help` in your URL bar. There may be a relaunch option where your Chrome version is. Otherwise, try to upgrade your Chrome version. Your Chrome version may be different from the ChromeDriver version downloaded by the program.\n\n## Personalizing the programs\n\nUpdate this section of the code if you want to bet on a different sport:\n\n```\nself.sport = 'Baseball'\n```\n\nUpdate these sections of the code if you want to change your bet amount, lower & upper arbitrage return limit and max odd limit:\n\n```\nself.main_bet_amount = 100  # Total amount to wager. The program will split the two bets, so that the total wager is this amount\nself.lower_limit = 0.000  # Lower arbritage limit to bet on, as a percentage\nself.upper_limit = 0.070  # Upper arbritage limit to bet on, as a percentage (0.070 = 7%)\nself.bet_limit = 0.10  # Most websites require a minimum of $0.10 a wager on each bet\nself.odds_limit = 750  # The program will not wager above these odds (i.e. +750)\n```\n\nMost references state that wagers should be rounded to the dollar to help avoid arbitrage detection. Update the round function below to zero decimal places if you need:\n\n```\nself.result = [round(x, 2) for x in self.result]\n```\n\nSubmitting a wager has been commented out in the programs. You can submit a wager by uncommenting this section of code:\n\n```\nself.pool.apply_async(self.process, args=(9, 0, 0, 0,))\nself.pool.apply_async(self.process, args=(10, 0, 0, 0,))\n# Join the pools so they run in parallel\nself.pool.join()\n```\n\n## Additional information about the programs\n\nThe programs use the naming convention \"bid\" and \"ask.\" I built the programs from a framework that traded binary options and did not update the naming convention. \"Bid\" means DraftKings or William Hill, while \"ask\" means FanDuel.\n"

In this project, I utilize the **Live Sports Odds API** (https://the-odds-api.com/) to find statistical arbitrage opportunities in upcoming sporting events across the world. For sports betting purposes, an arbitrage opportunity is when two books are offering such distinct odds that if a bettor makes a particular bet with one book and another particular bet with another book, they can hedge their bets in such a way that they will be guaranteed to make a profit. \n\nThe **Live Sports Odds API** is a free, open source API that tracks the current odds of essentially any given sporting event that is offered by books across the United States. With data from the API, the program is able to find all possible artbitrage opportunities across the eight nearest upcoming sporting events. Once the program finds these opportunities and makes the necessary calculations for the user to understand the output, it writes all findings to an Excel file for the user to access. This file includes the **ID** and **Sport Key** (both of which are specific metrics to the Live Sports Odds API), along with the **Expected Earnings, Bookmaker, Name, Odds**, and **Amount to Buy** with each book for each respective bet. Each row in the file represents one artbitrage opportunity.\n\nAll of the code for this program is included in the **Arbitrage.ipynb** file. Each chunk of code is commented so that the user knows exactly what is happening in each step of the program. Please note that the API does not update instantaneously, and since all books are constantly altering their odds as to eliminate such opportunities for bettors, the program will occasionally output odds that are slightly inaccurate due to the fact that they have already been updated on the book's website. \n\nThe **Books.txt** file contains a list of all of the US bookmakers that are supported by the **Live Sports Odds API** as of 3/17/22 for reference. This information is also on the documentation website for the API listed above.\n\nNOTE: In order to use this project, you will need to acquire an API key from the website linked above. It is entirely free. Once you have done this, add your API key to the **API_KEY.txt** file.\n"

Here is an example with given odds of -350 (US Odds), 180 (US Odds), 2.5 (Decimal Odds), 4.9 (Decimal Odds), 6-1 (Fractional Odds), 2/7 (Fractional Odds).\n\n```{r}\nimplied_prob(-350, type = \"us\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nimplied_prob(180, type = \"us\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nimplied_prob(2.5, type = \"dec\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nimplied_prob(4.9, type = \"dec\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nimplied_prob(6/1, type = \"frac\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nimplied_prob(2/7, type = \"frac\")\n```\n\n\n#### Odds from Probabilities\n\nLet's say you believe a bet has a 75% chance to cover, what would the price be? Using the implied odds function can give you the price based on your probability.\n\n```{r}\nimplied_odds(0.75, type = \"us\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nimplied_odds(0.75, type = \"frac\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nimplied_odds(0.75, type = \"dec\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nimplied_odds(0.75, type = \"all\")\n```\n\n#### Converting Odds\n\nLet's say you want to convert the American Odds you see on the screen (-175) to another type.\n\n```{r}\nconvert_odds(-175)\n```\n\n\n#### Calculate Sportsbook's hold\n\nBetting into a market is difficult enough as is but some sportsbooks skew the odds even more in their favor. (-110, -110) is the industry standard. The hold, or vig/juice, for this bet can be found like this:\n\n```{r}\nhold_calc(-110, -110)\n```\n\nSome sportsbooks in newly legalized states are taking advantage of bettors with lines (-125, -125)\n\n```{r}\nhold_calc(-125, -125)\n```\n\nThe increase in juice for this is:\n\n```{r}\n(hold_calc(-125, -125) - hold_calc(-110, -110)) / hold_calc(-110, -110)\n```\n\n120% increase in price.\n\n\n\n\n## Special Thanks \n\n* To the entire [A.I.

This information can then inform and improve trading strategies.\r\n\r\nAs it relies on web scraping, any changes to the scraped websites will invalidate the whole package. If you spot any bugs, then please raise an [issue](https://github.com/dashee87/betScrapeR/issues) or fork it and start a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nInstall from GitLab\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_git(\"https://gitlab.com/dashee87/betScrapeR.git\")\r\nlibrary(\"betScrapeR\")\r\n```\r\nYou can install from GitHub (identical mirror of GitLab)\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"dashee87/betScrapeR\")\r\nlibrary(\"betScrapeR\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can copy the R files onto your computer and run them all locally (only if the other approaches fail for some reason).\r\n\r\n### Required Packages\r\n\r\n[abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) is a package to perform calls on the Betfair exchange via its API. We will use [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) to retrieve exchange data. Please consult its extensive documentation, if you want design a trading strategy based on data derived from `betScrapeR`. As [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) is not supported by CRAN, you'll need to install it seperately. Similar to before, just install it directly from RStudio:\r\n\r\nInstall from GitLab\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_git(\"https://gitlab.com/phillc73/abettor.git\")\r\nlibrary(\"abettor\")\r\n```\r\nOr install from GitHub if you prefer (identical mirror of GitLab)\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"phillc73/abettor\")\r\nlibrary(\"abettor\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis exchange data is combined with the corresponding bookmakers' odds, which are scraped directly from odds comparison websites using [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf). [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf) works particularly well in combination with [SelectorGadget](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf), a handy internet browser extension that allows you to easily extract css tags from websites. As it's supported by CRAN, [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf) will be automatically installed with `betScrapeR` (if it's not already installed). So it's just [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) that you need to install manually.\r\n\r\n### Tutorial\r\n\r\nI've created a short tutorial on how to install and use `betScrapeR`, including an example showing how `betScrapeR` can be used to identify arbs. The tutorial can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dashee87/betScrapeR/vignettes/example.Rmd).\r\n\r\n### Obtain a Betfair Developer Application Key\r\n\r\nOnly people with betfair application (app) keys will be able to use this package. Therefore, you may need to obtain a developer app key for the Exchange API. Please follow the instructions [here](https://developer.betfair.com/get-started/#exchange-api). If you intend to use this package in a commercial context (e.g. software design), you need to apply for a [Betfair Software Vendor Licence](https://developer.betfair.com/default/api-s-and-services/vendor-program/vendor-program-overview/). Personal use of the `betScrapeR` package will only require an Exchange API app key.\r\n\r\nJust note that there are two types of application keys: delayed and live. The former is free but provides limited API functionality. For example, you can't place bets and market data is returned with a 1-60 second delay. In contrast, live app keys allow full functionality (place bets, market data with no delay, etc), but cost \u00a3299. I'm not too familiar with the delayed app key, as the live app key was free when I started out. If parts of the package are incomptible with a delayed app key, then please submit an [issue](https://github.com/dashee87/betScrapeR/issues). Please initially test the package with a delayed app key, bearing in mind your calls will be subject to a delay.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nThis package is under active development and is currently subject to regular updates.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the package only supports horse racing (not including races in Australia and New Zealand).\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\nWeb scraping alogirithms are very sensitive to minor website changes (and my code is not immune to more general bugs). Please let me know if something's not working.\r\n\r\n[Submit issues here](https://github.com/dashee87/betScrapeR/issues).\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\n* Complete horse racing functionality\r\n* Move onto tennis\r\n* Tackle football (one country, one league, one market at a time)\r\n* Shiny apps\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Betfair Online Betting Exchange](https://www.betfair.com)\r\n* [Betfair Developer Program](https://developer.betfair.com/)\r\n* [Betfair Exchange API Documentation](http://docs.developer.betfair.com/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni)\r\n* [rvest Documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf)\r\n* [Web Scraping with R tutorials](http://www.r-bloggers.com/search/web%20scraping)\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThe `betScrapeR` package is provided with absolutely no warranty. If you intend to incorporate this package into your trading strategies, please tread carefully. Start with small stakes; a small bug/mistake could lead to big losses.\r\n\r\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Ebets\nEbets is a decentralized betting platform, built using Ethereum, where you\ncan create and join bets.\n\nEbets focuses on sports and e-sports matches. You can access it in a convenient way\nat: [ebets.ch](https://ebets.ch) or at ipfs: \n\n## Running\nYou're right! To be fully decentralized you should be able to run it yourself,\nIt is supposed to be really simple:\n```\ncd front/\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\nOpen `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and you're ready to use the system.\n\n## Basics:\nThe contract roles are:\n\n1. Ebets\n2. User\n3. Arbiter\n\n#### Ebets\nEbets is used mainly to maintain the bets organized and indexed. We have a small fixed\nfee for this service, 1% of the losing side.\nThink of Ebets as a bets deposit: it will keep track of every bet created in the system,\nand index them accordingly.\n\nEbets' power over a bet is very limited and it can only:\n\n* Feature and unfeature a bet\n* Change the bet's category\n\n#### User\nUsers can:\n\n* Create bets\n* Bet on existing matches\n* Call the arbiter\n* Collect their rewards\n\nA user can create bets in the system, and those bets appear in the *unfeatured* section.\nA user can also bet on an existing match and collect the rewards of the bet.\n\n#### Arbiter\nThe arbiter plays a major role in our system, make sure you understand how it works.\n\nAn arbiter is responsible to decide the match's outcome. The arbiter itself is also a contract.\nFor the first test release, we have a **Monarch** arbiter that decides the bet outcome, but\ndon't worry, you can trust this monarch (said every tyrant).\n\nOur goal with the Monarch is just to bootstrap our community, as we encourage smart contract developers and the community\nto follow our interface for developing arbiters. We will later create a nice UI so that non-programmers\ncan also develop arbiters.\n\nArbiters are formed usually by a collection of trustworthy people, and some rules should exist for them\nto cast the outcome. For example, an arbiter can be composed by 3 members, where if 2 of them act\ncorrectly, the match's outcome is decided. In that way arbiters can minimize the chance of *failing*.\n\n##### What if an arbiter decides wrongly / doesn't decide?\nArbiters are encouraged to have a higher instance, like a court of appeals in legal terms. That court\nof appeals could be evoked to solve a dispute when arbiters collude to lie about an outcome.\nThere should also be a *slashing* mechanism to punish the faulty arbiters. We are still working on these concepts before any implementation follows.\n\n##### What if the higher instance colludes?\nThis is a recursive problem, we don't think there is an easy solution for that. We hope\nthat in higher instances the stakes are too high, and a collusion will do more damage than\nany outcome it can provide. We hope that every bet will have their own *trustworthy court*.\n\nBut this is for the future! Right now we should all follow the Monarch, or whatever arbiter you can come\nup with.\n\n## Workflow\n\nBets represent a match between two teams, let's call them Team A and Team B. There can be, in principle, 3 outcomes:\n\n1. Team A won\n2. Team B won\n3. Draw\n\nBets are accepted until the match begins. When the match begins, bets are no longer accepted.\nWhen the match ends, any user can invoke the Arbiter, and that call will make a proposal to the arbiter to decide.\nThe arbiter then, must decide the outcome until a fixed deadline.\nIf the arbiter doesn't decide until then, anyone can make the bet a Draw.\n\nOnce the result of the match is decided, the participants that have bet on the winning team can withdraw their rewards.\nThe reward consists of the original bet plus a percentage of his/her stakes multiplied by the loser's side pool,\nminus the 1% tax.\nLet's say Alice bets 1 ether on team A and Bob 1 ether on team B. Team A wins.\nWhen Alice withdraws, she will have 1 ether + 100% * (1-0.01) = 1.99 ether.\n\nThere is also a deadline when the bet can be self-destructed which is is encouraged to be long (couple of months).\nWhen the bet is self-destroyed, any ether it holds is transferred to Ebets.\n\n# Governance\nThis is a tool for us all to use.\nWe encourage the community to submit PRs to our repository and make suggestions in the Issues page. \n\n# TESTNET\nThe contracts are deployed in the **Kovan** testnet, so make sure you don't send any ether to the main network!\n\nThe system is unstable, so do not rely on the bets to be there in the following day, this is for testing only\nright now!\n\n# TODOs\n- [ ] Support ERC20 tokens\n- [ ] Make UI to create arbiters\n- [ ] Option to create no-fee private bets\n- [ ] Index bets by category in Ebets events\n- [ ] Fix my bets\n- [ ] Fix images for bets\n- [ ] Better format BigNumber\n- [ ] Fix \"Win\", sum with already bet by account, edit positioning\n- [ ] Paginate bets\n\n"

Please keep in mind that your regular Asianodds user (for the Web Interface) does not work for your API account and vice versa.\n\nThe purpose of the gem is to pre-configure all API calls to make your life as easy as just calling one method. You won't need to MD5 hash your password (as Asianodds requests) and the gem assumes smart pre-configs for your calls, so they will work even without passing in required parameters. Still, it has the same flexibility as the original API without limitations.\n\nWith just three lines of code you will be able to start placing real-time bets with multiple bookmakers and automate your trading strategies.\n\nFor any bugs, ideas or feature requests don't hesitate to open an issue.\n\n*Disclaimer: This gem is not officially developed by Asianodds and does not belong in any way to the Asianodds service, nor is it supported by their development team and all rights to accept or deny bets made with this gem remain with Asianodds.*\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'asianodds'\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    $ bundle install\n\nOr install it yourself as:\n\n    $ gem install asianodds\n\n## Usage\n\nAll returned objects from the gem are in the form of Ruby Hashes (or plain booleans if specified) with all Keys converted to Symbols.\n\n\n\n### Login\n\nCreate a new user instance and provide your username and raw password (not hashed):\n\n```ruby\nasianodds = Asianodds::Login.new('dagobert_duck', 'secure_password')\n#\n```\nThe returned response / initiated user will contain the following keys:\n\n|Key|Value|Description|\n|---|-----|-----------|\n|@user|dagobert_duck|This is your username|\n|@password|secure_password|This is your password|\n|@password_md5|hashed MD5 password|The password actually used to login|\n|@ao_token|random string ('2220749911057835565404619834') or ('')|Token passed to execute all methods|\n|@ao_key|random string ('3c81574f865d1d892d52d7cbc78a18dd') or (nil)|Key used once to register - only valid for 60s|\n|@base_url|https://webapi.asianodds88.com/AsianOddsService|Used url base to access the Asianodds service|\n|@code|0 or -1|Indicator whether current action was successful: 0 = true, -1 = false|\n|@successful_login|boolean|Shows whether user is logged in successfully|\n|@message|string ('Successfully Registered.')|Verbose description of the current user status|\n\n\n### Register\n\nWith the instantiation of the login call, you will automatically get registered to the app. There is no need to call the register method separately. The registration message can be read from the current users @message.\n\n\n### Login Check\n\nYou can check whether you are logged in to the service with the isloggedin? method. It returns either true if logged in or false if not.\n\n```ruby\nasianodds.isloggedin?\n# returns true or false\n```\n\nThis method is automatically called on each subsequent method to ensure you will be re-registered in case you are not logged in anymore. No need to manually check the logged in status.\n\n\n\n### Logout\n\nAfter finishing all transactions and business logic, it is wise to logout and unregister (happens automatically after 30 min of inactivity) with the logout method\n\n```ruby\nasianodds.logout\n# { Code: -1, Message: null, Result: \"Failed Logout. Have you logged in before ?\" }\n```\n|Key|Value|Description|\n|---|-----|-----------|\n|@code|0 or -1|Indicator whether current action was successful: 0 = true, -1 = false|\n|@message|-|Can be omitted|\n|@result|string ('Failed Logout.

  "readme_contents": "\ncrypto-champ\n============\n\nMotivation\n----------\nMainly and in short, to explore in depth the details of ethereum smart contract development with solidity, and to provide an educational example thereof. The main points to be hit: \n- creation of a data-providing oracle\n- use of an oracle \n- creation and use of library contracts\n- consumption of smart contract from front end using web3 \n- development using ganche testnet\n- testing using rinkeby testnet \n- deployment to mainnet\n\nOrganization of Code\n--------------------\n- Web3 client: https://github.com/jrkosinski/crypto-champ/tree/master/client\n- Oracle: https://github.com/jrkosinski/crypto-champ/tree/master/boxing-oracle\n- Main Oracle Code: https://github.com/jrkosinski/crypto-champ/tree/master/boxing-oracle/contracts\n- Contract: https://github.com/jrkosinski/crypto-champ/tree/master/sports-bets\n- Main Contract Code: https://github.com/jrkosinski/crypto-champ/tree/master/sports-bets/contracts\n\nHow it Works: Oracle\n--------------------\nThe oracle pushes data regarding upcoming & past boxing matches onto the ethereum blockchain. Its main function is to provide data on what boxing matches are available, and most importantly, who won them. The oracle is trusted to provide the correct winner for each match. Provides the following main user stories: \n- enter a new boxing match record \n- update status of a match (pending, underway, decided, etc.) \n- declare the winner of a match\n\nHow it Works: Contract\n----------------------\nAllows bets to be placed on matches, collects the bets, and pays out the winnings (a small percentage going to the house). Available matches are pulled directly from the oracle. \n\nThe process of betting is as such: \n- place a bet, specifying a match id, a chosen winner, and an amount to bet (must be above a set minimum); the funds to cover the bet are transferred in the function call \n- on a draw, all bets are refunded in full \n- on a loss, all funds sent are just gone forever\n- on a win, a percentage of the total pot is transferred to bettor, proportional to the size of his/her bet, and minus a small cut for the house \n\nProvides for the following main user stories: \n- query the matches currently available for betting \n- query past (decided) match results \n- place a bet \n- check the status of a bet or match \n \nHow it Works: Client\n--------------------\nNo client currently exists, as of this writing, for the oracle. The client allows users to: \n- see a list of bettable and decided matches \n- see a list of their own bets \n- query the total amount bet (by all users combined) on a particular match \n- place a bet \n- query the status of a bet or match \n\nLibraries Used or Adapted\n-------------------------\n- OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/ownership\n- OpenZeppelin's SafeMath contract https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/math"

We will be approving git push requests so if we see such actions we will deny the push and ask what the issue is.\n\nThis repo is by no means a final product, let it be a toolbox, sandbox, whatever it is the kids call it these days, remember, you are not competing against anyone here, we can all work together to beat the book, and I have no doubt we can. Now in the coming days we will be talking about how to incorporate models here to be shared with the Manat ecosystem so we can all track and let people lose money while they fade.\n\nFrom all of us here at Manat, we hope this space flourishes, invite your friend, invite everyone, experienced coder or novice, but lets make something special.\n\nYours truly, \nu/BrilliantScarcity354\n\nQUICK GIT REFRESHERS:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/ws2516/manat.git -- Use this to download the git repo (only need this for initial setup). Make sure you are in the desired directory, and it will create a folder named \"sportsbook\" with the repo.\n\ngit pull -- run this command before editing files always. Since for now we will be working together in the main branch, this will make sure you get the latest changes updated locally (will download all changes to the repo since last edit).\n\ngit status -- run this to check check which files you have edited and not committed / staged for commit. Make sure all edited files are staged and committed before pushing.\n\ngit add [filename] -- Stages edited file or new file for commit. To change file in repo for everyone else to see must first be staged, then commited, then pushed.\n\ngit add --all -- Stages all edited / new files for commit (a good shortcut)\n\ngit commit -m \"[some message here]\" -- This is the unit of change (if there is a problem we can roll it back to the previous commit). Type a message to indicate what changes have been made. Even between pushes you can commit multiple times.\n\ngit push -- uploads all commits (changes) to the repo on github for all to see\n\nsome file running tips\n\n\"interpretor.py\" is meant to be run at the completion of the sports day (00:00 when all games that have active bets are completed), this will ask for \"here to look\", that is a recap of the day, say \"no\" at first, then input the results of the day (array of 1s and 0s) corresponding to the bets in \"masterDaily.csv\", this file wil add them all and update the file. If you wish to recap the day, run the file again and answer \"yes\" to \"are you here to look\" -- this is by no means perfect so do understand you will have to debug\n\n\"processor.py\" is meant to be run once a day after interpretor, this yields the relevant bets and kelly weights of all bets for the coming day\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS: We would like to acknowledge the work created by 538 which we incorporate into many of our systems and has been an incredible resource, we wish to give credit where credit is due and hope to do more to bring people into the world of probabilistic sports outcomes and informed betting.\n\nFeel free to ping us on Reddit or on the following email: BrilliantScarcity354@gmail.com\n"

BARRY Are we going to pick our job today? ADAM I heard it\u2019s just orientation. The rows of chairs change in transformer-like mechanical motion to Universal Studios type tour trams. Buzzwell walks off stage. BARRY (re: trams) Whoa, heads up! Here we go. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 6. SEQ. 125 - \u201cFACTORY\u201d FEMALE VOICE (V.O) Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. (in Spanish) Dejen las manos y antennas adentro del tram a todos tiempos. BARRY I wonder what it\u2019s going to be like? ADAM A little scary. Barry shakes Adam. BARRY AND ADAM AAHHHH! The tram passes under SIGNS READING: \u201cHonex: A Division of Honesco: A Part of the Hexagon Group.\u201d TRUDY Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco, and a part of the Hexagon group. BARRY This is it! The Honex doors OPEN, revealing the factory. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Wow. TRUDY We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive where our top secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this... Trudy GRABS a TEST TUBE OF HONEY from a technician. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 7. TRUDY (CONT\u2019D) ...soothing, sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow, you all know as... EVERYONE ON THE TRAM (in unison) H-o-n-e-y. Trudy flips the flask into the crowd, and laughs as they all scramble for it. ANGLE ON: A GIRL BEE catching the honey. ADAM (sotto) That girl was hot. BARRY (sotto) She\u2019s my cousin. ADAM She is? BARRY Yes, we\u2019re all cousins. ADAM Right. You\u2019re right. TRUDY At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. ANGLE ON: A STUNT BEE in a HELMET getting hit with a NEWSPAPER, then a SHOE, then a FLYSWATTER. He gets up, and gives a \u201cthumb\u2019s up\u201d. The graduate bees APPLAUD. ADAM (re: stunt bee) What do you think he makes? BARRY Not enough. TRUDY And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 8. BARRY Wow, what does that do? TRUDY Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ANGLE ON: The Krelman machine. Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adam\u2019s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it\u2019s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because you\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn\u2019t know that. ADAM What\u2019s the difference? TRUDY And you\u2019ll be happy to know that bees as a species haven\u2019t had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So you\u2019ll just work us to death? TRUDY (laughing) We\u2019ll sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands. The frame freezes into a snapshot. Barry looks concerned. The tram continues through 2 doors. FORM DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 175 - \u201cWALKING THE HIVE\u201d INT. HONEX LOBBY ANGLE ON: The log-flume photo, as Barry looks at it. ADAM Wow. That blew my mind. BARRY (annoyed) \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Adam, how could you say that? One job forever? That\u2019s an insane choice to have to make. ADAM Well, I\u2019m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY But Adam, how could they never have told us that? ADAM Barry, why would you question anything? We\u2019re bees. We\u2019re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. They walk by a newspaper stand with A SANDWICH BOARD READING: \u201cBee Goes Berserk: Stings Seven Then Self.\u201d ANGLE ON: A BEE filling his car\u2019s gas tank from a honey pump. He fills his car some, then takes a swig for himself. NEWSPAPER BEE (to the bee guzzling gas) Hey! Barry and Adam begin to cross the street. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 10. BARRY Yeah but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? They stop in the middle of the street. The traffic moves perfectly around them. ADAM Like what? Give me one example. BARRY (thinks) ...I don\u2019t know. But you know what I\u2019m talking about. They walk off. SEQ. 400 - \u201cMEET THE JOCKS\u201d SFX: The SOUND of Pollen Jocks. PAN DOWN from the Honex statue. J-GATE ANNOUNCER Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Royal Nectar Force on approach. BARRY Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, hey, those are Pollen jocks. ADAM Wow. FOUR PATROL BEES FLY in through the hive\u2019s giant Gothic entrance. The Patrol Bees are wearing fighter pilot helmets with black visors. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) I\u2019ve never seen them this close. BARRY They know what it\u2019s like to go outside the hive. ADAM Yeah, but some of them don\u2019t come back. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 11. The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! You\u2019re monsters. You\u2019re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I don\u2019t know. BARRY Their day\u2019s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You can\u2019t just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Look at that. That\u2019s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\u2019s just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps, unless you\u2019re wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it. ANGLE ON: Two girl bees. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 12. ADAM Those ladies? Aren\u2019t they our cousins too? BARRY Distant, distant. ANGLE ON: TWO POLLEN JOCKS. JACKSON Look at these two. SPLITZ Couple of Hive Harrys. JACKSON Let\u2019s have some fun with them. The pollen jocks approach. Barry and Adam continue to talk to the girls. GIRL 1 It must be so dangerous being a pollen jock. BARRY Oh yeah, one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat, and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1 Oh my. BARRY I never thought I\u2019d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can autograph that if you want. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON Little gusty out there today, wasn\u2019t it, comrades? BARRY Yeah. Gusty. BUZZ You know, we\u2019re going to hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY Six miles, huh? ADAM (whispering) Barry. BUZZ It\u2019s a puddle-jump for us. But maybe you\u2019re not up for it. BARRY Maybe I am. ADAM (whispering louder) You are not! BUZZ We\u2019re going, oh-nine hundred at JGate. ADAM (re: j-gate) Whoa. BUZZ (leaning in, on top of Barry) What do you think, Buzzy Boy? Are you bee enough? BARRY I might be. It all depends on what oh-nine hundred means.

BARRY Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? MARTIN BENSON Son, let me tell you something about stirring. (making the stirring motion) You grab that stick and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm, it\u2019s a beautiful thing. BARRY You know dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn\u2019t right for me. MARTIN BENSON And you were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That\u2019s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 15. BARRY Well no... MARTIN BENSON Janet, your son\u2019s not sure he wants to go into honey. JANET BENSON Oh Barry, you are so funny sometimes. BARRY I\u2019m not trying to be funny. MARTIN BENSON You\u2019re not funny, you\u2019re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer. JANET BENSON You\u2019re going to be a stirrer?! BARRY No one\u2019s listening to me. MARTIN BENSON Wait until you see the sticks I have for you. BARRY I can say anything I want right now.

We have roses visual. Bring it around thirty degrees and hold. BARRY (sotto) Roses. JACKSON Thirty degrees, roger, bringing it around. Many pollen jocks break off from the main group. They use their equipment to collect nectar from flowers. Barry flies down to watch the jocks collect the nectar. JOCK Stand to the side kid, it\u2019s got a bit of a kick. The jock fires the gun, and recoils. Barry watches the gun fill up with nectar. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 23. BARRY Oh, that is one Nectar Collector. JOCK You ever see pollination up close? BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers to come back to life. JOCK (as he pollinates) I pick some pollen up over here, sprinkle it over here, maybe a dash over there, pinch on that one...see that? It\u2019s a little bit of magic, ain\u2019t it? The FLOWERS PERK UP as he pollinates. BARRY Wow. That\u2019s amazing. Why do we do that? JOCK ...that\u2019s pollen power, Kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY Cool.

They fly over a fountain. BUZZ I\u2019m picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don\u2019t we need those? SPLITZ Copy that visual.

SPLITZ This is the coolest. What is it? They stop at a BALL on a white line and look up at it. JACKSON I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m loving this color. SPLITZ (smelling tennis ball) Smells good.

Ken waits, poised for the return. We see Barry having trouble maneuvering the ball from fatigue. KEN (overly confident) Match point! ANGLE ON: Ken running up. He has a killer look in his eyes. He\u2019s going to hit the ultimate overhead smash. KEN (CONT'D) You can just start packing up Honey, because I believe you\u2019re about to eat it! ANGLE ON: Pollen Jocks. JACKSON Ahem! Ken is distracted by the jock. KEN What? No! He misses badly. The ball rockets into oblivion. Barry is still hanging on. ANGLE ON: Ken, berating himself. KEN (CONT\u2019D) Oh, you cannot be serious.

MONTGOMERY Ow! I\u2019m hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery. MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You can\u2019t treat them like equals. They\u2019re strip-ed savages! Stinging\u2019s the only thing they know! It\u2019s their way! ANGLE ON: Adam, collapsed on the floor. Barry rushes to his side. BARRY Adam, stay with me. ADAM I can\u2019t feel my legs. Montgomery falls on the Bailiff.

JUDGE Please, I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! FADE TO: SEQ. 3400 - \u201cADAM AT HOSPITAL\u201d INT. HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here\u2019s Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn\u2019t I? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is you\u2019re alive. You could have died. ADAM I\u2019d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\u2019s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\u2019t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\u2019m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\u2019re just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don\u2019t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don\u2019t check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don\u2019t smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\u2019s it! That\u2019s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It\u2019s not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I\u2019ve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can. CUT TO: SEQ. 3500 - \u201cSMOKING GUN\u201d INT.

ANGLE ON: The jury, all with paper boats of their own. JURORS Ooh. ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated with Gammil, who\u2019s making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil\u2019s boat, and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can\u2019t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\u2019s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a \u201chigh 5\u201d. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I\u2019m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer in headlights\u2019 expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery\u2019s right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We\u2019ve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - \u201cHONEY ROUNDUP\u201d EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we\u2019re going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95. I believe we\u2019re all aware of what they do in the woods. We will no longer tolerate derogatory beenegative nick-names, unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products, and la-dee-da tea-time human snack garnishments.

They turn the keys simultaneously, War Games-style, shutting down the honey machines. ANGLE ON: the Taffy-Pull machine, Centrifuge, and Krelman all slowly come to a stop. The bees look around, bewildered. WORKER BEE 5 What do we do now? A BEAT. WORKER BEE 6 Cannon ball!! He jumps into a HONEY VAT, doesn\u2019t penetrate the surface.

BARRY Mmmm...you know, I\u2019m going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY Specifically me. I guess I didn\u2019t think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it\u2019s not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that\u2019s our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if there\u2019s no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn\u2019t it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH. BARRY How about a suicide pact?

EVERYONE Flowers?! CUT TO: INT. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Well, we have an electrical storm in the area, and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience. JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater, there\u2019s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I\u2019m quite familiar with Mr. Benson\u2019s work, and his no-account compadres. Haven\u2019t they done enough damage already? JEANETTE CHUNG But isn\u2019t he your only hope right now? BUD Come on, technically a bee shouldn\u2019t be able to fly at all. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT. Barry REACTS BUD The wings are too small, their bodies are too big-- \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 116. BARRY (over PA) Hey, hold on a second. Haven\u2019t we heard this million times?

Barry\u2019s family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That\u2019s why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together. That\u2019s the bee way. We\u2019re not made of Jello.

VANESSA (CONT\u2019D) Barry, what happened? BARRY (noticing the control panel) Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot that whole time. VANESSA That may have been helping me. BARRY And now we\u2019re not! VANESSA (V.O.) (folding her arms) Well, then it turns out I cannot fly a plane. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 118. BARRY (CONT'D) Vanessa struggles with the yoke.

  "language": "TypeScript",
  "readme_contents": "# sbp\n\nDecentralized sports & event betting platform powered by Ethereum smart contracts and automated market making.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Event creation\n\nNew betting events will initially be created by the founding team by calling a `createEvent` method on the smart contract. In the future, this event data could be requested from a Chainlink oracle.\n\n### Betting\n\nAny Ethereum wallet can place bets on an event by calling the `placeBet` method on the smart contract and sending a bet option and wager amount in the form of ETH tokens.\n\nThis process will be facilitated by a web app which displays all events eligible for betting and allowing users to claim payouts for won bets.\n\nUsers will transfer funds and interact with the smart contract by connecting a Metamask wallet.\n\n### Outcome reporting\n\n#### Consensus Using Proof of Stake\n\n- Apply the proof of stake model to outcome reporting. Automating result reporting is not scalable, brittle, and requires some level of trust. The best way to get dependable results is to marginally incentive someone to answer honestly and massively penalize them for acting in bad faith. It's a self governed system that requires no belabored software automation efforts.\n\n  The idea is that when an event ends, someone can report a result via an offchain oracle. When reporting the result, the reporter must stake an amount that is more than the sum of the bets for that event. After a result is reported, the report can be disputed or verified by other staked reporters. Once a predetermined verification threshold is met, the event can be confidently resolved. The reporters get a small reward for reporting honestly. If they answered dishonestly, their stake is forfeited and used to correct payout amounts.\n\n  A clear downside to this approach is that an event pool may contain a large sum of money. It would be unreasonable to require a reporter to stake potentially hundreds of ETH just to report an event result. One approach to overcome this is to break the pool into sub pools and have multiple reporters that stake the amount relative to their pool size.\n\n  Pros: self-governed, fast event resolutions, trustless, scalable\n  Cons: requires motivated users to report/dispute results, requires a user to be flush with liquidity to report results\n\n#### Consensus Using Commit/Reveal Scheme with Random Node Selection\n\n1) Event ends\n2) Some percentage of nodes on the SBP network are randomly chosen to be event result voters\n3) Each voter calls a smart contract method to request a randomly generated proof-of-work assignment, which is used to force the voter to find some random nonce that they will reveal in a later step for vote verification purposes:\n\n```js\ncontract.requestProofOfWorkAssignment(eventId) => proofOfWorkAssignment\n```\n\n4) Voter completes the proof-of-work assignment locally, recording the nonce value discovered to fulfill the assignment (The necessity for this nonce will also be explained in a later step):\n\n```js\nproofOfWorkAssignment(nonce) => proofOfWorkFulfillment\n```\n\n5) Voter executes a local hashing function, passing their vote and the nonce (discovered in step 4) as inputs, and signing the output hashed data using their private key. This signed data acts as a vote verification key, which will be explained in a later step:\n\n```js\nsha256(vote, nonce) => hashedData\ncreateSignature(privateKey, hashedData) => voteVerificationKey\n```\n\n6) Voter calls a smart contract method to cast their vote, passing the signed vote verification key produced in step 5:\n\n```js\ncontract.castVote(voteVerificationKey)\n```\n\nSince this `voteVerificationKey` is a signed hash of the voter's vote and a privately held nonce, it does not reveal anything to public viewers (including other voters) about which way they voted, but it can be used later to ensure that the voter did not change their vote after others revealed their votes.\n\n7) Once a threshold of votes is reached on-chain, voting is closed and the smart contract will reject future votes for the event. This threshold is necessary to incentivize voters to vote quickly -- selected voters who do not vote before the threshold is reached will have their vote rejected and will thus not be able to collect voting rewards.\n8) After voting closes, voters can call a smart contract method to reveal their vote and discovered nonce:\n\n```js\ncontract.revealVote(vote, nonce)\n```\n\n9) The smart contract can verify the integrity of each vote (and ensure the voter did not change their vote after others revealed theirs) by checking the proof-of-work nonce and hashing the data (in the same way the voter did in step 5) and passing the output hashed data through a signature verification function:\n\n```js\nproofOfWorkAssignment(nonce) => proofOfWorkFulfillment\nsha256(vote, nonce) => hashedData\nverifySignature(publicKey, hashedData, voteVerificationKey) => boolean\n```\n\nSince the data returned from smart contract calls is publicly viewable, a nonce is necessary to prevent voters from easily brute forcing the hidden votes cast by other voters by just guessing through every possible vote and checking to see if that vote could be verified using their public key.\n\nThe nonce requires brute forcers to complete a proof-of-work and arrive at the identical nonce discovered by the voter, before they gain any information about their vote. Gaining access to other votes before casting a vote could cultivate consensus corruption, so it should be infeasible for one node to complete enough proof-of-work assignments assigned to other voters to gain a large amount of information before casting their vote.\n\n\n```js\n// this is too easy\nsha256(vote) => hashedData\ncreateSignature(publicKey, hashedData) => boolean\n```\n\n```js\n// this requires computational work and luck\nproofOfWorkAssignment(privateKey, nonce) => proofOfWorkFulfillment\nsha256(vote, nonce) => hashedData\ncreateSignature(publicKey, hashedData, voteVerificationKey) => boolean\n```\n\nA vote guessing attack becomes even less financially feasible due to the voting punctuality incentivization facilitated by the threshold defined in step 7.\n\n10) The smart contract discards any votes that were rejected by the `verifySignature` call in step 9 (i.e. votes that were changed after reveal) and counts the remaining votes to determine the winner.\n\n11) Voters who voted as part of the majority will receive a voting reward. This reward could be in the form of a newly minted governance token, a cut of the winners' pot, or a combination of both.\n\n12) The winning result is stored in the smart contract, unlocking the ability for winning bettors to claim payouts.\n\n#### Consensus Using Chainlink Oracles\n\n(need details here)\n\n### Staking\n\nIn order to create a highly liquid market, the platform will incentivize users to stake funds into a liquidity pool, which will be used to payout winning bets. Having a highly liquid pool ensures that, no matter which side wins a bet, there is enough ETH in the pool to pay out all the winners, even if the platform loses money overall.\n\nTo incentivize stakers, the platform can offer a percentage cut of the platform fee to the liquidity pool, where each liquidity provider earns a staking reward in proportion to the amount of ETH they are staking relative to the overall pool.\n\nWith this model, early stakers will potentially make up a large percentage of the liquidity pool and therefore earn high rewards, but as more stakers add liquidity, it will lower the early stakers' earnings, as they now make up a smaller percentage of the liquidity pool.\n\nThis creates a self-correcting system -- in scenarios where there is a low amount of liquidity, people will be more incentivized to stake because rewards will be higher; in contrast, in scenarios where there is excess liquidity, rewards will be lower, incentivizing stakers to exit the liquidity pool and deploy their capital into something more productive.\n\n### Odds making\n\nOne of the main project challenges is defining the initial payout odds for an event, which in traditional sports betting is usually done by a combination of proprietary computer algorithms and \"experts\".\n\nThese initial odds could potentially be informed using Chainlink oracles to get the initial sports betting odds defined by Vegas and global sportsbooks.\n\nAnother approach is to allow anyone on the platform to create a new betting market for an event (for which the odds will be auto-adjusted as bets come in from both sides), and staking an amount of ETH into the pool to sufficiently cover payouts for either result.\n\nWith this model, odds makers will be incentivized to set the initial odds to align as closely as possible with the real world expected outcome in order to maximize their profit by having a balanced book; this is reflective of how most traditional sportsbooks make money.\n\n### Passive earning\n\nThe platform can move betting pool funds into a decentralized lending platform like [Aave](https://aave.com) or [Compound](https://compound.finance) and earn interest from borrowers. This passive interest earning can be passed off to users of the platform in the form of better odds payouts and/or a betting rewards system.\n\n### Betting rewards system\n\nThe platform can incentivize users to place bets by rewarding every placed bet with a number of reward points proportional to the size of the bet. Points could later be redeemed for ETH by calling the `redeemPointsForEth` method on the smart contract. These points could be tracked directly on the blockchain in a mapping of `address => pointsEarned`. Alternatively, the rewards points could be tokenized, allowing users to trade rewards tokens freely across wallets.\n\n### Governance\n\nThe platform will initially be bootstrapped and governed in large part by the founding team. As the community grows and the platform matures, governance\nwill be incrementally transferred over to the community in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).\n\nHolders of a platform-minted ERC20 governance token may cast votes to adopt and reject new proposals to the platform protocol.\n\n### Governance token distribution\n\nThe governance token could be distributed as a reward to odds makers for maintaining platform events, proportional to the number of events they maintain relative to the total number of events on the platform.\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Smart Contract Development\n\nClone the repository:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/angelle-sw/sbp\n```\n\nCreate a `.env` file in the root of your repository (You can use [Infura](https://infura.io) to spin up a test endpoint):\n\n```sh\nTEST_ENDPOINT=<endpoint>\nWALLET_MNEMONIC=<wallet-mnemonic>\nWALLET_INDEX=<wallet-index>\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn\n```\n\nCompile contracts:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn compile\n```\n\nBoot up local Ganache network:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn blockchain:local\n```\n\nDeploy contract to local Ganache network:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn migrate\n```\n\nDeploy contract to Ropsten testnet:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn migrate:testnet\n```\n\nRun tests:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn test\n```\n\nRun tests and report test coverage:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn coverage\n```\n\nGenerate types for tests:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn types:truffle\n```\n\n### Front End Development\n\nGenerate types for frontend:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn types:ethers\n```\n\nChange into client directory:\n\n```sh\n$ cd client\n```\n\nStart app in development mode:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn start\n```\n\nBuild app:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn build\n```\n\nLint app:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn lint\n```\n\nRun tests:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn test\n```\n"

Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:\n\n- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).\n- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).\n- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.\n- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).\n- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).\n- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).\n- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).\n\nLaravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.\n\n## Learning Laravel\n\nLaravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework, making it a breeze to get started learning the framework.\n\nIf you're not in the mood to read, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) contains over 1100 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, JavaScript, and more. Boost the skill level of yourself and your entire team by digging into our comprehensive video library.\n\n## Laravel Sponsors\n\nWe would like to extend our thanks to the following sponsors for helping fund on-going Laravel development. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please visit the Laravel [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/taylorotwell):\n\n- **[Vehikl](https://vehikl.com/)**\n- **[Tighten Co.](https://tighten.co)**\n- **[British Software Development](https://www.britishsoftware.co)**\n- [Fragrantica](https://www.fragrantica.com)\n- [SOFTonSOFA](https://softonsofa.com/)\n- [User10](https://user10.com)\n- [Soumettre.fr](https://soumettre.fr/)\n- [CodeBrisk](https://codebrisk.com)\n- [1Forge](https://1forge.com)\n- [TECPRESSO](https://tecpresso.co.jp/)\n- [Pulse Storm](http://www.pulsestorm.net/)\n- [Runtime Converter](http://runtimeconverter.com/)\n- [WebL'Agence](https://weblagence.com/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for considering contributing to the Laravel framework!

The models predict each fighter's respective components and then a final model calculates the component differentials and predicts an outcome probability.\n\nThe goal of this project was to show the entire process of starting and finishing a machine learning project. This entails data scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and deployment/app development.\n\n## File Dictionary\n\nModel Development\n\n  - `Data_Scraping.R`\n  - `Data_Cleaning.R`\n  - `Feature_Engineering.RMD`\n  - `Modeling.RMD`\n  - `Future_Card_Predictions.RMD`\n  - `Model_Pipeline.RMD`\n  \nModels\n\n  - `outcome_model.RDS`\n  - `kd_model.RDS`\n  - `td_model.RDS`\n  - `sub_model.RDS`\n  - `sig_strike_model.RDS`\n  - `strike_model.RDS`\n\nApp \n\n  - `app.R`\n  - `modules.RDS`\n"

This project implements **[moneyline betting](https://news.sportsinteraction.com/guide/moneyline-betting-explained)**. Make sure you know what it actually is to better appreciate the project.\n\n# Demo\n[![Demo](https://github.com/deepbodra97/ethereum-sports-betting/blob/master/images/thumbnail.PNG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz0a59W_D6Y)\n\nThe live demo can be found [here](https://fortunether.herokuapp.com/). Read the guidelines for the demo to work as expected\n\n![alt screenshot](https://github.com/deepbodra97/ethereum-sports-betting/blob/master/images/home.png)\n\n## Features\n\n 1. Add Bet\n\t 1. The admin of the system can add new bets to the system\n\t 2. The admin is responsible for setting the betting odds\n\t 3. After a bet has been added, the status of the bet is considered as Open meaning the users can bet on it now\n 2. Bet\n\t 1. Now, the users can bet Ethereum on a team of their choice\n\t 2. The amount they bet is recorded on the blockchain\n\t 3. Also the Ether they bet is stored in the smart contract\n 3. My Bets\n\t 1. The users can see all their bets along with the amount they earned/lost\n 4. Close a bet\n\t 1. The toss in the game can affect the outcome of the game\n\t 2. So, the admin closes the bet before the toss\n\t 3. The bet status is now Closed\n 5. Start Payout\n\t 1. Once the game has finished the admin can select the winner and start payouts.\n\t 2. The winners will be listed and ethers will be sent out to them depending upon the amount of their bet.\n\t 3. The ether stored in the smart contract earlier is released and used in the payout process\n 6. Redeem\n\t 1. Once the payout has finished, there are chances that the smart contract still has ethers left over \n\t 2. Using this, the admin can get the ether transferred to his address.\n\n## Guidelines to test the demo\n1. Import this private key `ed6d7422eb57924e8b6d071ae87f226638f28cee56447a16f5cdfc39325b687b` into your metamask account. Using this key you can test the admin only features. \nA few humble requests: \n\t1. Don't steal the fake ethers in the account\n\t2. Use only 1 ether while testing because there aren't many\n2. Whitelist the url of the website in metamask (as shown in the dependencies)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n 1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n 2. Truffle\n\t  `npm install -g truffle`\n 3. [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)\n 4. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) \n\t 1. Once the account is ready, you will be connected to the Main Ethereum network. To connect to the local blockchain that was setup by Ganache, Click Main Ethereum Network and then go to Custom RPC. \n\t 2. Set **Network Name**:  \"anything you like\"\n\t      Set **New RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:7545 \n\t 3. Whitelist the localhost address in the settings\n\n## Executing the code\n\n1. Initialising Blockchain Ledger\n\t``truffle migrate --reset``\n2. Running the Decentralised App(Server)\n\t``npm run dev``\n\n## Credits\n\nShoutout to [goodvibration](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/users/16043/goodvibration) and [Rob Hitchens](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/users/5549/rob-hitchens-b9lab) for answering my questions on Stack Exchange\n"

FairHome)\n```\n\nAs rowwise() slows down the calculation and the calculation of fair values for Home and Away odds is a common use case odds.fv() has an option (Vectorized2wayOutput1stElement = TRUE), which can speed up the computation significantly for this specific use case.\n\n```{r}\ndf %>% \n  mutate(FairHome = odds.fv(Home,Away,\n                            input =   \"dec\",\n                            output = \"prob\",\n                            Vectorized2wayOutput1stElement = TRUE)) %>% \n  mutate(FairAway = 1 - FairHome)\n```\n\n### Calculate Parlays\n\nTo calculate the fair price for a parlay input the betting odds of each of the parlay legs and use odds.parlay()\n\n```{r}\nodds.parlay(c(-105,-110),output=\"dec\")\n"

Furthermore, the package comes with tidy datasets for historical NBA (work in progress), MLB, NFL (work in progress), and NHL (work in progress) Vegas lines for moneylines, point totals, and point spreads.\n\nThese functions take inspiration from posts by user \"Ganchrow\" on the Sportsbook Review forum.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` r\nremotes::install_github(\"pwu97/bettingtools\")\n```\n\n## Analyze 2019 MLB Historical Odds\n\nInside the `bettingtools` package is the 2019 MLB historical odds dataset, `mlb_odds_2019`, where we can utilize functions in this package to answer interesting questions such as what was the average moneyline for games in the 2019 MLB season using a bar chart.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(bettingtools)\nlibrary(teamcolors)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(forcats)\ntheme_set(theme_light())\n\nmlb_colors <- teamcolors::teamcolors %>%\n  filter(league == \"mlb\") %>%\n  rename(team = name) %>%\n  select(team, primary)\n\naway_team_lines <- mlb_odds_2019 %>%\n  select(away_name, away_close_ml) %>%\n  mutate(implied_ml = US2Implied(away_close_ml)) %>%\n  rename(team = away_name) %>%\n  select(team, implied_ml)\n\nhome_team_lines <- mlb_odds_2019 %>%\n  select(home_name, home_close_ml) %>%\n  mutate(implied_ml = US2Implied(home_close_ml)) %>%\n  rename(team = home_name) %>%\n  select(team, implied_ml)\n\navg_2019_mlb_ml <- rbind(away_team_lines, home_team_lines) %>%\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  summarize(avg_implied_ml = mean(implied_ml),\n            avg_ml_line = Implied2US(mean(implied_ml))) %>%\n  left_join(mlb_colors, by = \"team\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(avg_ml_line)) %>%\n  slice(-n()) %>%\n  mutate(team = fct_reorder(team, avg_ml_line, .desc = TRUE),\n         primary = fct_reorder(primary, avg_ml_line, .desc = TRUE)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Generate moneyline bar chart\nmlb_2019_ml_chart <- avg_2019_mlb_ml %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = team, y = avg_ml_line, label = avg_ml_line)) +\n  geom_col(fill = avg_2019_mlb_ml$primary) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(y = \"Average Moneyline\",\n       x = \"Team Name\",\n       title = \"What was the average moneyline for each team during\\nthe 2019 MLB Season?\")\n\n```\n\n![2019 Average MLB Moneylines](mlb_2019_ml_chart.jpg)\n\nWe can also, for example, calculate the average over/under movement, the average away/home closing moneyline, and whether the closing moneylines are sharper than the opening moneylines given by Vegas, on average. We can see that home teams tended to be favored more often, on average, than away teams. Furthermore, there is also evidence that closing moneylines were indeed sharper than opening moneylines by about 2%.\n\n```{r}\n# What is the average O/U movement for games in which there was line movement?\nmlb_odds_2019 %>%\n  mutate(ou_movement = close_ou_line - open_ou_line) %>%\n  filter(ou_movement != 0) %>%\n  summarize(mean_ou_movement = mean(ou_movement)) %>%\n  pull(mean_ou_movement)\n\n# What is the average away closing moneyline?\nmlb_odds_2019 %>%\n  mutate(away_implied = US2Implied(away_close_ml)) %>%\n  summarize(avg_away_closing_ml = Implied2US(mean(away_implied))) %>%\n  pull(avg_away_closing_ml)\n\n# What is the average home closing moneyline?\nmlb_odds_2019 %>%\n  mutate(home_implied = US2Implied(home_close_ml)) %>%\n  summarize(avg_home_closing_ml = Implied2US(mean(home_implied))) %>%\n  pull(avg_home_closing_ml)\n\n# Are closing moneylines sharper than opening moneylines?\nmlb_odds_2019 %>%\n  mutate(fav_team_won_open = ifelse((((away_score > home_score) & \n                                      (away_open_ml < home_open_ml)) |\n                                     ((away_score < home_score) & \n                                      (away_open_ml > home_open_ml))), 1, 0),\n         fav_team_won_close = ifelse((((away_score > home_score) & \n                                      (away_close_ml < home_close_ml)) |\n                                     ((away_score < home_score) & \n                                      (away_close_ml > home_close_ml))), 1, 0)) %>%\n  summarize(pct_fav_won_open = mean(fav_team_won_open, na.rm = TRUE),\n            pct_fav_won_close = mean(fav_team_won_close, na.rm = TRUE),\n            pct_diff = pct_fav_won_close - pct_fav_won_open)\n```\n\n## Calculate single Kelly stake\n\nWe can calculate the percentage of one's bankroll one should bet to maximize the expected growth of one's bankroll on a single bet. Given an expected win probability, payout odds, and an optional Kelly multiplier factor, we can calculate one's optimal single Kelly stake. Note that default odds for the expected win probability is implied probability (\"prob\") and the default odds for the payout is in decimal (\"dec\"). We can change them accordingly to how we see fit by specifying additional parameters in our function (\"prob\", \"dec\", \"us\").\n\n```{r example}\nlibrary(bettingtools)\n\ncalculateKellyStake(0.53, 1.92)\n\ncalculateKellyStake(0.41, 2.56)\n\n# Getting a bet at +150 when it is expected to hit at -120\ncalculateKellyStake(-120, 150, expected_odds = \"us\", payout_odds = \"us\")\n\n# Getting a bet at -150 when expected probability is 70% at a 10% kelly multiplier.\ncalculateKellyStake(0.70, -150, kelly_multiplier = 0.1, payout_odds = \"us\")\n\n# Optimal move is to not place a bet\ncalculateKellyStake(0.26, -110, payout_odds = \"us\")\n```\n\n## Calculate all possible win-loss outcomes given probabilities\n\nWe return a tibble where each row is one possible outcome we can observe from a list of given probabilities.\n\n```{r}\ncalculateWinRanges(c(.1, .4, .88, .47))\n\ncalculateWinRanges(c(.12, .462, .29))\n\ncalculateWinRanges(c(.6, .6, .6, .6))\n```\n\n\n## Calculate zero-vig implied probabilities\n\nWe can calculate the zero-vig implied probabilities of a vector of lines. The default precision is set to 4 digits. Note that we can set the precision.\n\n```{r}\ncalculateZeroVigProb(c(200, -180, -450, 800))\n\ncalculateZeroVigProb(-237)\n\ncalculateZeroVigProb(-237, precision = 7)\n```\n\n##  Calculate implied probabilities for two-outcome line set\n\nWe can calculate the implied probabilities for two or more lines by first calculating the zero-vig implied probabilities for both of them, and then normalizing them. Again, we can set the precision. \n\n```{r}\ncalculateNormalizedImplied(c(1000, -800), precision = 7)\n\ncalculateNormalizedImplied(c(200, -220))\n\ncalculateNormalizedImplied(c(427, -213, 336))\n```\n\n## Calculate theoretical hold\n\nWe can calculate the theoretical hold for a two-outcome line set. This corresponds to the profit a sportsbook would expect to make were a player to bet on either side of an event with all else being equal. Contrary to popular belief, larger nominal spreads doesn't necessarily mean more profit for bookies.\n\n```{r}\ncalculateTheoreticalHold(c(-110, -110))\n\ncalculateTheoreticalHold(c(-1500, 875))\n\ncalculateTheoreticalHold(c(-1500, 875), precision = 7)\n```\n\n## Convert American or Decimal Odds to Zero-Vig Fair Odds\n\nWe can convert a pair of American or Decimal odds to the fair zero-vig counterpart by calculating the individual zero-vig probabilities and then normalizing them. \n\n```{r}\nUS2Fair(c(265, -375))\n\nUS2Fair(c(150, -200))\n\nDec2Fair(c(2.14, 1.86))\n\nDec2Fair(c(4.00, 1.51))\n```\n\n## Converting between American, Decimal, and Implied Odds\n\nWe can convert between American, Decimal, and Implied Odds.\n\n```{r}\nUS2Implied(c(-250, 600, 137, -110))\n\nUS2Dec(c(-250, 600, 137, -110))\n\nUS2All(c(-250, 600, 137, -110))\n\nDec2Implied(c(3.17, 2.14, 2.01, 1.67))\n\nDec2US(c(3.17, 2.14, 2.01, 1.67))\n\nDec2All(c(3.17, 2.14, 2.01, 1.67))\n\nImplied2Dec(c(.34, .54, .88, .12))\n\nImplied2US(c(.34, .54, .88, .12))\n\nImplied2All(c(.34, .54, .88, .12))\n```\n\n"

If you have questions, you can reach me directly at william@wagerlab.app.\n\n<br>\n\nThis model was built by the developer of WagerLab, a mobile app for betting on sports and current events with your friends. Please consider giving the app a download (and a nice review:pray:). It would really mean a lot to me! :grimacing:\n\n[<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/socialbetproduction.appspot.com/o/wagerlab-purple-logo-text-small.png?alt=media&token=454a81be-747b-4dfc-94bb-9eb82afd4dda\">](https://www.wagerlab.app/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n[<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/socialbetproduction.appspot.com/o/a-store-2.png?alt=media&token=ffa151ab-139e-4dce-9837-0df7942d1369\">](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wagerlab/id1460332027) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<img src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/socialbetproduction.appspot.com/o/g-play-2.png?alt=media&token=35c7c808-5340-4d07-b280-9003e5d3260f\">](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialbet.android)\n\n## Methodology\n### Theory\nThere's value in analyzing trands among many independent prediction models because a collection of models will interpret considerably more data and will consider such data in an exponentially greater number of ways compared to any single model. ThePredictionTracker is an extremely valuable source of data aggregation in this regard. However, their aggregated model simply takes an average of all the predicted spreads and compares that average to the actual spread. The problem with this is that each model has it's own normal distribution with considerably different variances compared to the line.  For example, 3 points of value over the spread in Model A might mean a lot if Model A has low variance from the spread but would mean very little for Model B with a high variance from the spread.\n\nThe goal of this model is to first normalize each model's predicted value over the spread for each pick. This creates a superior basis for combining the models' projections by game. For each game, we can take the mean of these standardized values from the line. We'll then rank these values to identify the top picks within the listed games.\n\n\n### Implementation\n1. Iterate through all games and all models. For each game model pair, save the difference between the away team's predicted spread and the actual spread. Add an additional copy of these values to a distribution list for each model.\n2. Iterate through all game-model pairs again and calculate the z-score of each projected spread difference using the previously saved value as well as the mean and std deviation of the distribution list of the given model.\n3. For each game, calculate the mean of the z-scores previously calculated for that game\n4. Order the games by the absolute value of these mean z-scores and return the ordered picks. (For the non-absolute value, negative means the away team is the value pick and positive means the home team is.) \n\n## Usage\nFeel free to copy this for your own purposes or contribute. If you have questions, reach out to william@wagerlab.app.\n### Commands\n\n`npm run nfl` Runs the NFL point spread model \n\n`npm run ncaaf` Runs the NCAA Football point spread model \n\n`npm run nba` Runs the NBA point spread model \n\n`npm run ncaab` Runs the NCAA Basketball point spread model \n\n\n### Walkthrough\n\n1. **Pull down this package**\n   - You can also do this manually using the green \"Clone or download\" button above or on the command line by running `git clone https://github.com/wagerlab/model-aggregator.git` \n   - Once you have this package, navigate to it on the command line\n2. **Ensure you have the proper dependencies and permissions**\n   - You will need to have node and npm installed. Check if node is installed by running `node -v`. Check if npm is installed by running `npm -v`. If you see a version number, the software is installed, but if you get nothing back, you need to install it.  [Here is info about how to install node and/or npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).\n   - Set read/write permissions on main script by running `sudo chmod -R 777 generatePicks.js`\n3. **Run the model**\n   - See the 'Commands' section above for the specific commands to run depending on which data you want to view.\n\n\n## Consideration\nWithout ThePredictionTracker.com, building this would be considerably more complicated.

I'm not sure of the legal status of gambling on sports where you live, but first and foremost, don't do illigal things.  This project should be viewed as a tool to learn from, not a tool to break laws.  I will say there are opportunities, at least when I ran it for long periods of time five years ago.  They don't appear to stay open very long.  I never exploited any of the opportunities.\n\nI've periodically received requests to get this running again.  I'm going to attempt to summarize that process here.  This is old code.  I have no intention of upgrading it, although I'd be happy to offer advice if someone is interested.\n\nSetup\n-----\nThe easiest way to get this code running is to launch it through Virtualbox using Vagrant.  If you haven't used either of these tools, you can install Virtualbox from here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.  Vagrant can be installed from here: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.\n\nYou can launch the VM by navigating to the root of this project and running:\n\n```bash\n  vagrant up\n```\n\nThis will provision an Ubuntu 14.04 server with Ruby 1.8.7 and MySQL installed as well as required gems.  MySQL is installed with a root password of 'root'.  The code for this project will be mounted in /home/vagrant/app. You can work outside the VM, using whatever editor you'd like, and run the code in the vm to test.\n\nTo log into the VM:\n\n```bash\n  vagrant ssh\n```\n\nthen:\n```bash\n  cd app\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Apache .htaccess example\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n"

If neither of these are used the script will read the value of `$API_KEY`. `.env` files are also supported and automatically loaded.\n\n### Region\nDifferent parts of the world have different bookmakers. To reflect this the `-r` or `--region` arguments allow you to set the region in which to search. Accepts the values `\"eu\"`,`\"us\"`, `\"uk\"`, and `\"au\"`. \n\n### Unformatted\nUsing the `-u` or `--unformatted` flags will remove the pretty printing and simply dump the json which contains the arbs to the console directly. Use this if you intend to extend upon the script in some way, for regular usage the formatted print is significantly better.\n\n### Cutoff\nThe `-c` or `--cutoff` allow you to set a minimum profit margin. Should be set as a percentage, so `-c 10` means a 10% profit margin. Defaults to 0 (i.e. any profitable arb will be displayed).\n\n### Help\nThe `-h` or `--help` flags will show a short help message with documentation.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Four Alpha | https://www.fouralpha.bet\n\n## Background\n\nRecently, the global betting market has experienced exponential growth, fueled by rapid expansion of legalization across multiple states and growing popularity of moibile betting platforms. With the increased number of bookmakers offering pregame and live odds on a variety of sports markets (NBA, NHL, MLB, NFL, MLS, EPL, La Liga, Ligue 1, and more), in many ways, sports betting has become like a financial market, with bookmakers valuing assets by pricing betting odds for outcomes of various events, and the public 'buying' these assets by wagering money on an outcome. Thus, like any financial market, the concept of arbitrage can be leveraged to generate a guaranteed return on investment (ROI).\n\nArbitrage in sports betting involves placing a bet on all possible outcomes of an event in order to guarantee a profit. In a wager of any kind, the odds placed on an event refect the payout of that event, often implying a probability associated with it. For example, if I flip a coin and win $5 if it's heads or lose $5 if it's tails, then since the payouts are equal, I'm implying that the probability of a heads or tails occuring is 50%. In a fair game, the implied probabilities of the payouts of all possibilities in an event should add up to 1.\n\nNormally, the odds provided by a single sportsbook on a given event are intentionally placed such that the implied probabilities of the event add up to greater than 1 and the bookmaker benefits regardless of who wins. For example, if the Celtics are playing the Lakers, then bookmaker A might offer Celtics Moneyline at -300 and Lakers Moneyline at +200. Each odd represents a payout, which is really just a measure of how likely either side will win. -300 implies 75% and +200 implies 33.33%. The implied probabilities add up to 108.3%. This doesn't make sense because the probaility that the Celtics or the Lakers win is 100%. That extra 8% is the cut bookmakers take known as 'juice'. The house always has an advantage. \n\nHowever, odds across different sportsbook vary because differnt sportsbooks have different opinions on the probability of an event. These lines are even more volatile with live betting lines. Differing opinions and volatile lines present an opportunity to find an event whose implied probabilities of all possibilities add up to a number less than 1. This would actually end up guaranteeing a profit for us, regardless of who wins. For example, if bookmaker A offers Celtics Moneyline at -330 and bookmaker B offers Lakers Moneyline at +450, then betting the right amount on both would guarantee a return. Mathematically, their implied probabilities add up to 93%, which means there is about a 7% profit for us.\n\nWe are currently working on a suite of propriery products that use data analysis in order to exploit market inefficiencies and produce other types of profitable wagering opportunities.\n\n## Application\n\nIn its initial iteration, Four Alpha uses an in-house Python engine to gather odds from 15+ international bookmakers on 60+ sports betting markets. The engine parses the response and algorithmically detects arbitrage opportunities for a given event. We run the engine on both historical odds to generate a record of past arbitrage opportunities as well as live odds to detect current available arbitrage opportunities.\n\nWhen arbitrage is detected, a record of it is created and stored in Firebase. Our React front end connects to the Cloud Firestore and grabs all of the arbitrage records to put on display. The front end is deployed and hosted on Vercel.  \n\n## Pictures\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/home.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"383\">\n  <img src=\"images/table.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"383\">\n</div>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  Home Page and Arb Table\n</p>\n\n## Technlogies\n- ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)\n- ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)\n- ![Firebase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase-039BE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=Firebase&logoColor=white)\n- ![Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/vercel-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white)\n- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)\n- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)\n\n---\n*\u00a9 2023 Four Alpha*\n"

  "readme_contents": "\nThe history of this project simple. There were some client that asked me to implement sports bets on ethereum smart contracts. Technical task were next: \"I want sports bet project on smart contracts\".\nBut after I've implemented the last part we agreed, client told that he requested only 1/4 of all project, and did not pay for the last part. At really he asked to make 3/4 of the project.\nSince I did not sign any NDA and client broke our voice agreement, I have rights for this project. Thats all.\n\nArchitecture:\n- UI(latest Angular,DEMO: http://wizardly-hugle-9ff596.bitballoon.com) should be integrated with public backend(which is not implemented), and use bet function from smart contract. Bet event should be added.\n- DAPP solidity smart contract\n- isolated backend(node.js), that acting as a simple wrapper around smart contract. \n- public backend, which is not implemented. Should interact with UI and isolated backend.\n\nDetails:\nIt should create games in the blockchain on demand, to prevent losing on not popular games. Also DAPP Game creation should be protected by captcha.\n\n\nThere is only 3/4 of overall project ready. This repo contains smart contract and UI code. Isolated backend : https://github.com/vitaliy-kuzmich/bets-backend\n\n\nThis is free software.  \n"

  "readme_contents": "# nfl-sports-betting\nModel created to predict outcomes of nfl games with the goal of making bets to win money!\n#### -- Project Status: [Inactive]\n\n## Project Intro/Objective\nThe purpose of this project is to be able to accurately predict the outcome of NFL matches using various algorithms and interesting features. Me and my group of friends collectively contributed $200 (with an extra $100 donated by my professor) to bet on the model's predictions. The stakes are high!\n\n### Methods Used\n* Exploratory Analysis\n* SVM\n* Random Forest\n* Logistic Regression\n* Ensemble Methods\n\n### Technologies/Languages\n* R and RStudio\n\n## Project Description\nBeing extremely interested in football, I decided to try and predict the outcome of NFL games using data I found on Kaggle, score spreads from sports betting websites, ELO predictions from fivethirtyeight, and some of my own features, to try and see if I can make accurate predictions this season and (hopefully) make some money in the process. In the NFL the home team wins 57% of the time. This can serve as a perfect benchmark when predicting the results of games.\n\nSports betting in the NFL comprises of three main betting methods: spread betting, moneyline, and over/under. \n\n### Spread Betting\nLike many high scoring sports, NFL wagering is dictated by the point spread. The spread, or line, is a type of side bet that equalizes the chance of winning a wager. The line offered for any given team will be accompanied with a \u2013 or + symbol to indicate whether a team is a favorite or an underdog. Although not the focus for this project, the spread could be a useful feature in determining which team the \"house\" thinks will most likely win the game.\n\n### Over/Under\nThe concept of betting on totals, or Over/Under, is quite simplistic. The bettor wagers on whether the TOTAL points scored in a game will fall over or under a pre-determined number set by the sportsbook. Like the spread, the Over/Under prediction can also be a predictor of the outcome of a game, since if a game is low-scoring there should be therefore less chances to score, throwing in an element of luck into the game.\n\n### Moneyline\nIn the parity driven NFL, the phrase \u201cany given Sunday\u201d is more prevalent than ever, which is why Moneyline bets can be very profitable when betting on the underdog. A Moneyline wager is one that is placed on either the favorite or the underdog to win straight up. Optimizing Moneyline bets will be the focus of this project.\n\n## Description of my Current Process\nHere's a breakdown of the steps I took and the conclusion I arrived at:\n\nFirst, I found three different datasets online that will make up the features that I will be testing. They are: \n\n### 1) Spreadspoke \nBetting websites like www.spreadspoke.com not only release point spread predictions of all weekly games, but also release datasets online of all the NFL games played since 1968 along with their respective features. This data will be the main dataset that I will be cleaning and modeling on.\n\n### 2) Teams\nSince the spreadspoke data does not contain the team ID of all teams, a separate dataset of all teams along with their respective short-hands and ID's were found on www.kaggle.com. This dataset will serve as a useful mapping tool for team ID's to team names in case I would want to manipulate home/away team into favourite/underdog team (spoilers, I will!).\n\n### 3) Fivethirtyeight ELO \nInterestingly, www.fivethirtyeight.com is an online sports blog that develops their own ELO rating of team for each season on a rolling basis. I wanted to use some of their features to see whether or not they added to my model's predictive power.\n\n### Cleaning\nNext, I began importing the data from this repo and did some preliminary analysis of spreadspoke.csv since that is going to be the main dataframe I'll be working with.\n\n```r\n# setting path\npath = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peanutshawny/nfl-sports-betting/master/data/\"\nspreadspoke = paste(path, \"spreadspoke_scores.csv\", sep = \"\")\nteams = paste(path, \"nfl_teams.csv\", sep = \"\")\nelo = paste(path, \"nfl_elo.csv\", sep = \"\")\n\n# reading in core nfl csv, teams csv, and elo csv\nnfl_df <- read.csv(spreadspoke, header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\nteams_df <- read.csv(teams, header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\nelo_df <- read.csv(elo, header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n```\n\nThe data looks to be mostly normal, except for the over 2,400 missing values for spread_favorite and over_under_line as they should be some of our main predictors. Upon closer inspection, all spread_favorite and over_under_line is missing for any season before 1978, and should be taken into account before training the model. There also seems to be sporadically-missing weather data, which is small enough that most of it can be fixed through imputation, with the exception of weather_humidity with over 7,500 missing values.\n\n![](images/nfl_df_summary.PNG)\n\nI then removed unecessary features from teams_df, then right outer joining teams_df onto nfl_df and renaming the column names to be team ID's. This will prove useful in mapping home/away teams to favorite/underdog teams later on.\n\n```r\n# dropping unnecessary features from teams_df\nteams_df <- teams_df[, c(1, 3)]\n\n# merging with nfl_df to map team ids to team names\nnfl_df <- merge(nfl_df, teams_df, by.x = \"team_home\", by.y = \"team_name\")\nnfl_df <- merge(nfl_df, teams_df, by.x = \"team_away\", by.y = \"team_name\")\n\n# renaming column names\ncolnames(nfl_df)[c(18, 19)] <- c(\"home_id\", \"away_id\")\n```\n\nDeleting all rows with blank favourite ID's.\n\n```r\nnfl_df <- subset(nfl_df, team_favorite_id != \"\")\n\n# replacing all remaining blanks into NA's\nnfl_df[nfl_df == \"\"] <- NA\n```\n\nMaking sure each home/away id matches with each favorite/not favorite id and mapping new scores.\n\n```r\n# setting factors to characters so as to avoid errors\nnfl_df$home_id <- as.character(nfl_df$home_id)\nnfl_df$away_id <- as.character(nfl_df$away_id)\n\n# mapping scores to favorite team instead of home/away to create win/loss variable\nnfl_df <- mutate(.data = nfl_df, score_fav = if_else(home_id == team_favorite_id, \n                                                     score_home, score_away))\nnfl_df <- mutate(.data = nfl_df, score_notfav = if_else(home_id == team_favorite_id, \n                                                     score_away, score_home))\n\n# mapping new scores to fav/notfav teams\nnfl_df <- mutate(.data = nfl_df, win_loss = if_else(score_fav > score_notfav, \"fav\", \"underdog\"))\n```\nAdding home/away win variable, editing weather detail variable to specify indoor/outdoor conditions. Any absence of \"DOME\" is presumed to have been played outdoors with the roof open.\n\n```r\n# setting weather detail to character so as to avoid errors\nnfl_df$weather_detail <- as.character(nfl_df$weather_detail)\n\n# need to map out all unique values of weather detail\nnfl_df <- mutate(.data = nfl_df, indoor_outdoor = if_else(startsWith(weather_detail, \"DOME\"), \n                                                          \"indoors\", \"outdoors\"))\n\n# deleting original weather detail feature\nnfl_df$weather_detail <- NULL\n```\n\nFilling in numbers to represent different playoff weeks.\n\n```r\nnfl_df$schedule_week <- as.character(nfl_df$schedule_week)\n\nnfl_df$schedule_week[nfl_df$schedule_week == \"18\"] = \"17\"\nnfl_df$schedule_week[nfl_df$schedule_week == \"Wildcard\"] <- \"18\"\nnfl_df$schedule_week[nfl_df$schedule_week == \"Division\"] <- \"19\"\nnfl_df$schedule_week[nfl_df$schedule_week == \"Conference\"] <- \"20\"\nnfl_df$schedule_week[nfl_df$schedule_week == \"Superbowl\"] <- \"21\"\n\nnfl_df$schedule_week <- as.numeric(nfl_df$schedule_week)\n```\nGrouping elo data by different teams over different time periods. I cut elo_df into two (team1 and team2) to make it easier to work with. Specifically, I thought grouping elo data by year would yield the best results, as team performance could theorietically be averaged out during a season, leading to more stable predictions. This avoided the issue of mapping the exact games by date. The threshold year of 1998 was created to ensure that older games, which should not be accurate depictions of future games, are ommitted from the model.\n\n```r\n# cutting out all elo data before threshold year\nthreshold_year <- 1998\nelo_df <- subset(elo_df, season > threshold_year)\n\n# cutting elo_df into two and grouping by team and year, taking the mean qelos of each team\nelo_df1 <- elo_df[, c(2, 5, 9, 11, 21, 27)]\nelo_df2 <- elo_df[, c(2, 6, 10, 12, 22, 28)]\n\nelo_df1 <- subset(elo_df1, is.na(elo1_post) == FALSE)\nelo_df2 <- subset(elo_df2, is.na(elo2_post) == FALSE)\n\n# grouping and summarising\nelo_df1 <- group_by(elo_df1, season, team1)\nelo_df2 <- group_by(elo_df2, season, team2)\n\nelo_df1 <- elo_df1 %>%\n  summarise(elo_prob1 = mean(elo_prob1),\n                        elo1_post = mean(elo1_post),\n                        qbelo_prob1 = mean(qbelo_prob1),\n                        qbelo1_post = mean(qbelo1_post))\nelo_df2 <- elo_df2 %>%\n  summarise(elo_prob2 = mean(elo_prob2),\n                        elo2_post = mean(elo2_post),\n                        qbelo_prob2 = mean(qbelo_prob2),\n                        qbelo2_post = mean(qbelo2_post))\n\n# changing the name of a column for ease of merging\nnames(elo_df2)[2] <- \"team1\"\n\n# recombining the dataframes and joining onto nfl_df\nelo_df <- merge(elo_df1, elo_df2, by = c(\"team1\", \"season\"))\n```\n\nTaking the mean of a feature depending on when a team has been home/away, then joining onto nfl_df by season and team ID. I only joined on raw ELO score, as all metrics in the dataset were highly correlated.\n\n```r\n# joining onto nfl_df and mapping respective features to fav/underdog teams\nelo_df <- elo_df %>%\n  rowwise()%>%\n  mutate(elo_prob = mean(c(elo_prob1, elo_prob2))) %>%\n  mutate(elo = mean(c(elo1_post, elo2_post))) %>%\n  mutate(qbelo_prob = mean(c(qbelo_prob1, qbelo_prob2))) %>%\n  mutate(qbelo = mean(c(qbelo1_post, qbelo2_post))) \n\nelo_df <- elo_df[, -c(3:10)]\n\n# joining on only elo, all other variables were extremely similar\nelo_df <- elo_df[, c(1, 2, 4)]\n\nnfl_df <- merge(nfl_df, elo_df, by.x = c(\"schedule_season\", \"home_id\"), by.y = c(\"season\", \"team1\"), all = TRUE)\nnfl_df <- merge(nfl_df, elo_df, by.x = c(\"schedule_season\", \"away_id\"), by.y = c(\"season\", \"team1\"), all = TRUE)\n\n# changing elo column names, then taking qbelo differential and mapping onto fav/underdog teams\ncolnames(nfl_df)[c(23:24)] <- c(\"home_elo\", \"away_elo\")\n\nnfl_df <- nfl_df %>% mutate(fav_elo = if_else(home_id == team_favorite_id, home_elo, away_elo)) %>%\n  mutate(underdog_elo = if_else(home_id == team_favorite_id, away_elo, home_elo)) %>%\n  mutate(fav_elo_diff = fav_elo - underdog_elo) \n```\n\nAdding the \"underdog/favorite home team\" feature. I had a hunch that the favorite team would have a higher chance of winning when they also the home team, since home teams by default win 57% of games. In contrast, the underdog team would also have a higher chance of winning if they were playing at home, balancing the odds in their favor.\n\n```r\nnfl_df <- mutate(.data = nfl_df, home_fav = if_else(home_id == team_favorite_id, \"home_fav\", \"home_underdog\"))\n```\n\nDeleting all unecessary features.\n\n```r\n# deleting all rows with NA favorite ID's and anything before a certain year\nnfl_df <- subset(nfl_df, team_favorite_id != \"\")\nnfl_df <- subset(nfl_df, schedule_season > threshold_year)\n\n# using only 13 features\nnfl_df <- nfl_df[, c(1, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 27, 28)]\n```\n\nImputing NA values using various methods from the MICE package\n\n```r\n# plotting missing values\naggr_plot <- aggr(nfl_df, col=c('navyblue','red'), numbers = TRUE, sortVars = TRUE, \n                  labels=names(nfl_df), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c(\"Histogram of missing data\",\"Pattern\"))\n\n```\n\n![](images/aggr_plot1.PNG)\n\nBecause over 70% of indoor_outdoor and over 50% of weather_humidity is missing, I will need to delete those columns as I have no way of imputing the data accurately.\n\n```r\nnfl_df$indoor_outdoor <- NULL\nnfl_df$weather_humidity <- NULL\n\naggr_plot <- aggr(nfl_df, col=c('navyblue','red'), numbers = TRUE, sortVars = TRUE, \n                  labels=names(nfl_df), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c(\"Histogram of missing data\",\"Pattern\"))\n```\n\n![](images/aggr_plot2.PNG)\n\nAs all features now all fall within the exceptable range of NA values (~5%), I used the mice package to impute all missing values with the predictive mean value method.\n\n```r\n# create a mice dataset\nimputed_data <- mice(data = nfl_df, m = 5, method = \"pmm\", maxit = 5, seed = 500)\n\n# complete the imputation\nnfl_df <- complete(imputed_data, 1)\n```\n\n### Modeling\nNormalizing, then separating into training/testing.\n\n```r\n# re-arranging and making sure all features are in the correct order in order to normalize\nnfl_df <- nfl_df[, c(3, 8, 10, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9)]\n```\n\nCalculating the size of training/testing, mean/sd of schedule seasons, and the appropriate cut off date before normalizing, as normalization is detrimental to the interpretation of the season feature. I benchmarked the testing set to be 20% of the data and calculated the number of years from the total number of years still present in the dataset.\n\n```r\n# optimal testing size\ntest_size <- 0.2\ntotal_years <- max(nfl_df$schedule_season) - min(nfl_df$schedule_season)\ntest_years <- round(test_size * total_years)\n\nseason_mean <- mean(c(min(nfl_df$schedule_season):max(nfl_df$schedule_season)))\nseason_sd <- sd(c(min(nfl_df$schedule_season):max(nfl_df$schedule_season)))\n\ncut_off <- ((max(nfl_df$schedule_season) - test_years) - season_mean)/season_sd\n\n# characterizing and normalizing\nfor (i in 1:ncol(nfl_df)){\n  if (i <= 3){\n    nfl_df[, i] = as.character(nfl_df[, i])\n  } else {\n    nfl_df[, i] = (nfl_df[, i] - mean(nfl_df[, i]))/sd(nfl_df[, i])\n  }\n}\n\n# converting into dummies for consistency among models\nnfl_df <- nfl_df %>%\n  mutate(schedule_playoff = if_else(schedule_playoff == \"TRUE\", 1, 0)) %>%\n  mutate(win_loss = if_else(win_loss == \"fav\", 1, 0)) %>%\n  mutate(home_fav = if_else(home_fav == \"home_fav\", 1, 0))\n\n# training/testing split\ntraining_set <- nfl_df[nfl_df$schedule_season <= cut_off, ]\ntesting_set <- nfl_df[nfl_df$schedule_season > cut_off, ]\n```\n\nThis should be the final dataset before going into the modeling phase. All cateogrical features have been made into dummies for ease of training between different models. All numerical features have been normalized before being split up into training/testing.\n\n![](images/final_df.PNG)\n\nBuilding Models, including a KNN, Randomforest, Logistic Regression, and SVM.\n\n```r\nsvm_model <- svm(win_loss ~., data = training_set, kernel = \"radial\", cost = 5)\nforest_model <- randomForest(win_loss ~., data = training_set, ntree = 150 )\nlog_model <- glm(win_loss ~., data = training_set, family = binomial(logit))\n```\n\nMaking predictions and rounding to later calculate misclassification.\n\n```r\nsvm_predictions <- predict(svm_model, testing_set, type = \"response\")\nsvm_predictions <- round(svm_predictions)\n\nforest_predictions <- predict(forest_model, testing_set, type = \"response\")\nforest_predictions <- round(forest_predictions)\n\nlog_predictions <- predict(log_model, testing_set, type = \"response\")\nlog_predictions <- round(log_predictions)\n```\n\nEvaluating errors in the form of a misclassification rate.\n\n```r\n# svm error\nwrong <- sum(svm_predictions != testing_set$win_loss)\nmisclassification_rate <- wrong/nrow(testing_set)\nprint(misclassification_rate)\n\n# random forest errors\nwrong <- sum(forest_predictions != testing_set$win_loss)\nmisclassification_rate <- wrong/nrow(testing_set)\nprint(misclassification_rate)\n\n# logistic regression error\nwrong <- sum(log_predictions != testing_set$win_loss)\nmisclassification_rate <- wrong/nrow(testing_set)\nprint(misclassification_rate)\n```\n\nBelow are the results of my three models before any major hyperparameter tuning. It's good to see that at around 70% accuracy, my models beat the 57% of the home team winning.\n\n![](images/model_results.PNG)\n\nBecause I was curious about ensemble methods, I decided to then build an ensemble model that used a max voting method to combine these three models and see if the accuracy improves. I first had to test the correlation between all model predictions, as there is not to voting if all models output similar predictions.\n\n```r\n# building prediction dataframe\npred_df <- data.frame(svm_predictions, forest_predictions, log_predictions)\n\n# measuring correlation between model predictions\ncor(pred_df)\n```\n\nSeems the models are approaching, but don't reach the threshold for high correlation of 0.75. It seems reasonable to still build the ensemble. \n\n![](images/results_corr.PNG)\n\n```r\n# building ensemble predictions that performs a majority vote \nensemble_predictions <- pred_df %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  transmute(en_pred = if_else(sum(svm_predictions, forest_predictions, log_predictions) >= 2, \n                              1, 0))\n\n# calculating misclassification/FP/FN\nwrong <- sum(ensemble_predictions != testing_set$win_loss)\nmisclassification_rate <- wrong/nrow(testing_set)\nprint(misclassification_rate)\n\nfalse_positive <- sum(ensemble_predictions == 1 & testing_set$win_loss == 0)\nfalse_negative <- sum(ensemble_predictions == 0 & testing_set$win_loss == 1)\n\nfalse_positive_rate <- false_positive/nrow(testing_set)\nfalse_negative_rate <- false_negative/nrow(testing_set)\n\nprint(false_positive_rate)\nprint(false_negative_rate)\n```\n\nIn addition to a misclassification rate, I also added a false positive and false negative rate to see how often the model predicts the favorite team or underdog team to win incorrectly. In the end, our ensemble model outperformed the logistic regression by 0.3%, a very slight improvement.\n\n![](images/ensemble_results.PNG)\n\nIt's interesting to see the false positive rate (falsely predicting the favorite team to win) being so much higher than the false negative rate (falsely predicting the underdog team to win). This might stem from an imbalance of data in this dataset, since most games have the favorite teams winning. There could also be not enough features that predict the possibility of an upset, such as winstreak (that effectively measure momentum) or injury rate (star player not being able to play).\n\n### Betting Real Money!\nAfter building this model, a group of friends and I felt confident enough to pool together $200 between five of us to start making bets on the model predictions, below is an example of us winning a Moneyline bet on the Baltimore Ravens:\n\n![](images/betting.PNG)\n\nStay tuned until the end of the 2019 season where I will announce our total winnings/losses! (Update - We lost over $300 in the regular season...)\n\n## Conclusion & Next Steps\nAll in all, I learned a lot about cleaning data in r, sports betting, and the different types of classical ML algorithms one can apply to solves problems like this. \n\nNext Steps:\n* Find or create more interesting features (player injury rate, rolling average win rate, head-to-head win rate, win streak)\n* Fine-tune each model before inputting into the ensemble\n* Research a way to fine-tune the ensemble for higher predictive power\n* Explore different betting strategies to maximize financial gain, perhaps even to the extent of layering an additional model that optimizes for the most money won.\n* Continue making bets!\n\n## Contact\nFeel free to email me at shawnliu30@gmail.com if you want to talk about this project or data science in general!\n"

Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.\nOoh, black and yellow!\nLet's shake it up a little.\nBarry! Breakfast is ready!\nComing!\nHang on a second.\nHello?\nBarry?\nAdam?\nCan you believe this is happening?\nI can't.\nI'll pick you up.\nLooking sharp.\nUse the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.\nSorry. I'm excited.\nHere's the graduate.\nWe're very proud of you, son.\nA perfect report card, all B's.\nVery proud.\nMa! I got a thing going here.\nYou got lint on your fuzz.\nOw! That's me!\nWave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\nBye!\nBarry, I told you, stop flying in the house!\nHey, Adam.\nHey, Barry.\nIs that fuzz gel?\nA little. Special day, graduation.\nNever thought I'd make it.\nThree days grade school, three days high school.\nThose were awkward.\nThree days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.\nYou did come back different.\nHi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\nHear about Frankie?\nYeah.\nYou going to the funeral?\nNo, I'm not going.\nEverybody knows, sting someone, you die.\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\nSuch a hothead.\nI guess he could have just gotten out of the way.\nI love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.\nWell, Adam, today we are men.\nWe are!\nBee-men.\nAmen!\nHallelujah!\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\nWelcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.\nThat concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!\nWill we pick our job today?\nI heard it's just orientation.\nHeads up! Here we go.\nKeep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.\nWonder what it'll be like?\nA little scary.\nWelcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.\nThis is it!\nWow.\nWow.\nWe know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.\nOur top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!\nThat girl was hot.\nShe's my cousin!\nShe is?\nYes, we're all cousins.\nRight. You're right.\nAt Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.\nThese bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.\nWhat do you think he makes?\nNot enough.\nHere we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.\nWhat does that do?\nCatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.\nSaves us millions.\nCan anyone work on the Krelman?\nOf course. Most bee jobs are small ones.\nBut bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.\nBut choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.\nThe same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.\nWhat's the difference?\nYou'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.\nSo you'll just work us to death?\nWe'll sure try.\nWow! That blew my mind!\n\"What's the difference?\"\nHow can you say that?\nOne job forever?\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\nI'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.\nBut, Adam, how could they never have told us that?\nWhy would you question anything? We're bees.\nWe're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.\nYou ever think maybe things work a little too well here?\nLike what? Give me one example.\nI don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.\nPlease clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.\nWait a second. Check it out.\nHey, those are Pollen Jocks!\nWow.\nI've never seen them this close.\nThey know what it's like outside The Hive.\nYeah, but some don't come back.\nHey, Jocks!\nHi, Jocks!\nYou guys did great!\nYou're monsters!\nYou're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\nI wonder where they were.\nI don't know.\nTheir day's not planned.\nOutside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.\nYou can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.\nRight.\nLook. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.\nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.\nThose ladies?\nAren't they our cousins too?\nDistant. Distant.\nLook at these two.\nCouple of Hive Harrys.\nLet's have fun with them.\nIt must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!\nHe had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!\nOh, my!\nI never thought I'd knock him out.\nWhat were you doing during this?\nTrying to alert the authorities.\nI can autograph that.\nA little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?\nYeah. Gusty.\nWe're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.\nSix miles, huh?\nBarry!\nA puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.\nMaybe I am.\nYou are not!\nWe're going 0900 at J-Gate.\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\nAre you bee enough?\nI might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.\nHey, Honex!\nDad, you surprised me.\nYou decide what you're interested in?\nWell, there's a lot of choices.\nBut you only get one.\nDo you ever get bored doing the same job every day?\nSon, let me tell you about stirring.\nYou grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\nIt's a beautiful thing.\nYou know, Dad, the more I think about it,\nmaybe the honey field just isn't right for me.\nYou were thinking of what, making balloon animals?\nThat's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.\nJanet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!\nBarry, you are so funny sometimes.\nI'm not trying to be funny.\nYou're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!\nYou're gonna be a stirrer?\nNo one's listening to me!\nWait till you see the sticks I have.\nI could say anything right now.\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\nLet's open some honey and celebrate!\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!\nI'm so proud.\nWe're starting work today!\nToday's the day.\nCome on! All the good jobs will be gone.\nYeah, right.\nPollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...\nIs it still available?\nHang on. Two left!\nOne of them's yours! Congratulations!\nStep to the side.\nWhat'd you get?\nPicking crud out. Stellar!\nWow!\nCouple of newbies?\nYes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!\nMake your choice.\nYou want to go first?\nNo, you go.\nOh, my. What's available?\nRestroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.\nAny chance of getting the Krelman?\nSure, you're on.\nI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\nWax monkey's always open.\nThe Krelman opened up again.\nWhat happened?\nA bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.\nDeady. Deadified. Two more dead.\nDead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!\nOh, this is so hard!\nHeating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.\nBarry, what do you think I should... Barry?\nBarry!\nAll right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...\nWhat happened to you?\nWhere are you?\nI'm going out.\nOut? Out where?\nOut there.\nOh, no!\nI have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.\nYou're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?\nAnother call coming in.\nIf anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.\nHey, guys.\nLook at that.\nIsn't that the kid we saw yesterday?\nHold it, son, flight deck's restricted.\nIt's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.\nReally? Feeling lucky, are you?\nSign here, here. Just initial that.\nThank you.\nOK.\nYou got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.\nSo be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.\nAlso, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.\nMurphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!\nThat's awful.\nAnd a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!\n All right, launch positions!\nBuzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

I'm out!\nI can't believe I'm out!\nSo blue.\nI feel so fast and free!\nBox kite!\nWow!\nFlowers!\nThis is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.\nBring it around 30 degrees and hold.\nRoses!\n30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.\nStand to the side, kid.\nIt's got a bit of a kick.\nThat is one nectar collector!\nEver see pollination up close?\nNo, sir.\nI pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.\nSee that? It's a little bit of magic.\nThat's amazing. Why do we do that?\nThat's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\nCool.\nI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?\nCopy that visual.\nWait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.\nSay again? You're reporting a moving flower?\nAffirmative.\nThat was on the line!\nThis is the coolest. What is it?\nI don't know, but I'm loving this color.\nIt smells good.\nNot like a flower, but I like it.\nYeah, fuzzy.\nChemical-y.\nCareful, guys. It's a little grabby.\nMy sweet lord of bees!\nCandy-brain, get off there!\nProblem!\nGuys!\nThis could be bad.\nAffirmative.\nVery close.\nGonna hurt.\nMama's little boy.\nYou are way out of position, rookie!\nComing in at you like a missile!\nHelp me!\nI don't think these are flowers.\nShould we tell him?\nI think he knows.\nWhat is this?!\nMatch point!\nYou can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!\nYowser!\nGross.\nThere's a bee in the car!\nDo something!\nI'm driving!\nHi, bee.\nHe's back here!\nHe's going to sting me!\nNobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!\nHe blinked!\nSpray him, Granny!\nWhat are you doing?!\nWow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.\nI gotta get home.\nCan't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.\nMayday! Mayday! Bee going down!\nKen, could you close the window please?\nKen, could you close the window please?\nCheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.\nOh, no. More humans. I don't need this.\nWhat was that?\nMaybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!\nThat is diabolical.\nIt's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.\nWhat's number one? Star Wars?\nNah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.\nNo wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.\nWhen I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.\nThere's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.\nI don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.\nI predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.\nWait! Stop! Bee!\nStand back. These are winter boots.\nWait!\nDon't kill him!\nYou know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!\nWhy does his life have less value than yours?\nWhy does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?\nI'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.\nMy brochure!\nThere you go, little guy.\nI'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.\n Put that on your resume brochure.\nMy whole face could puff up.\nMake it one of your special skills.\nKnocking someone out is also a special skill.\nRight. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.\nVanessa, next week? Yogurt night?\nSure, Ken. You know, whatever.\nYou could put carob chips on there.\nBye.\nSupposed to be less calories.\nBye.\nI gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.\nAll right, here it goes.\nNah.\nWhat would I say?\nI could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.\nI can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.\nOh, I can't do it. Come on!\nNo. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.\nHow should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good.\nHere she comes! Speak, you fool!\nHi!\nI'm sorry. You're talking.\nYes, I know.\nYou're talking!\nI'm so sorry.\nNo, it's OK. It's fine.\nI know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.\nWell, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.\nThis is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!\nI am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.\nAnd if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.\nThat was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.\nYeah.\nI'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\nI'll leave now.\nWait! How did you learn to do that?\nWhat?\nThe talking thing.\nSame way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\nThat's very funny.\nYeah.\nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.\nAnyway... Can I... get you something?\nLike what?\nI don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?\nI don't want to put you out.\nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\nIt's just coffee.\nI hate to impose.\nDon't be ridiculous!\nActually, I would love a cup.\nHey, you want rum cake?\nI shouldn't.\nHave some.\nNo, I can't.\nCome on!\nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\nWhere?\nThese stripes don't help.\nYou look great!\nI don't know if you know anything about fashion.\nAre you all right?\nNo.\nHe's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.\nHe finally gets there.\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\nThe wedding is on.\nAnd he says, \"Watermelon?\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\"\nIs that a bee joke?\nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\nYeah, different.\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\nAbout work? I don't know.\nI want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.\nI know how you feel.\nYou do?\nSure.\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\nReally?\nMy only interest is flowers.\nOur new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.\nAnyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\nNo way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.\nWhy do girls put rings on their toes?\nWhy not?\nIt's like putting a hat on your knee.\nMaybe I'll try that.\nYou all right, ma'am?\nOh, yeah. Fine.\nJust having two cups of coffee!\nAnyway, this has been great.\nThanks for the coffee.\nYeah, it's no trouble.\nSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.\nAre you...?\nCan I take a piece of this with me?\nSure! Here, have a crumb.\nThanks!\nYeah.\nAll right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.\nOK, Barry.\nAnd thank you so much again... for before.\nOh, that? That was nothing.\nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\nThis can't possibly work.\nHe's all set to go.\nWe may as well try it.\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\nSounds amazing.\nIt was amazing!\nIt was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.\nHumans! I can't believe you were with humans!\nGiant, scary humans!\nWhat were they like?\nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\nThey eat crazy giant things.\nThey drive crazy.\nDo they try and kill you, like on TV?\nSome of them. But some of them don't.\nHow'd you get back?\nPoodle.\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.\nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.\nWell...\nWell?\nWell, I met someone.\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\nA wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\nNo, no, no, not a wasp.\nSpider?\nI'm not attracted to spiders.\nI know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.\nSo who is she?\nShe's... human.\nNo, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.\nHer name's Vanessa.\nOh, boy.\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\nWe're not dating.\nYou're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!\nShe saved my life! And she understands me.\nThis is over!\nEat this.\nThis is not over! What was that?\nThey call it a crumb.\nIt was so stingin' stripey!\nAnd that's not what they eat.\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\nYou know what a Cinnabon is?\nNo.\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...\nSit down!\n...really hot!\nListen to me!\nWe are not them! We're us.\nThere's us and there's them!\nYes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?\nThere's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!\nYou have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!\nThinking bee.\nThinking bee.\nThinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!\nThere he is. He's in the pool.\nYou know what your problem is, Barry?\nI gotta start thinking bee?\nHow much longer will this go on?\nIt's been three days! Why aren't you working?\nI've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.\nWhat life? You have no life!\nYou have no job. You're barely a bee!\nWould it kill you to make a little honey?\nBarry, come out. Your father's talking to you.\nMartin, would you talk to him?\nBarry, I'm talking to you!\nYou coming?\nGot everything?\nAll set!\nGo ahead. I'll catch up.\nDon't be too long.\nWatch this!\nVanessa!\nWe're still here.\nI told you not to yell at him.\nHe doesn't respond to yelling!\nThen why yell at me?\nBecause you don't listen!\nI'm not listening to this.\nSorry, I've gotta go.\nWhere are you going?\nI'm meeting a friend.\nA girl? Is this why you can't decide?\nBye.\nI just hope she's Bee-ish.\nThey have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?\nTo be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!\nUp on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.\nA tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?\nNo. All right, I've got one.\nHow come you don't fly everywhere?\nIt's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.\nYeah, OK, I see, I see.\nAll right, your turn.\nTiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!\nYou don't have that?\nWe have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.\nOh, my.\nDumb bees!\nYou must want to sting all those jerks.\nWe try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.\nSo you have to watch your temper.\nVery carefully.\nYou kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.\nOh, my goodness! Are you OK?\nYeah.\nWhat is wrong with you?!\nIt's a bug.\nHe's not bothering anybody.\nGet out of here, you creep!\nWhat was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?\nYeah, it was. How did you know?\nIt felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.\nYou've really got that down to a science.\nI lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.\nI'll bet.\nWhat in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?\nHow did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?\nIs he that actor?\nI never heard of him.\nWhy is this here?\nFor people. We eat it.\nYou don't have enough food of your own?\nWell, yes.\nHow do you get it?\nBees make it.\nI know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!\nThere's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!\nIt's organic.\nIt's our-ganic!\nIt's just honey, Barry.\nJust what?!\nBees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!\nYou've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!\nAnd it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.\nI'm getting to the bottom of all of this!\nHey, Hector. You almost done?\nAlmost.\nHe is here. I sense it.\nWell, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.\nYou're busted, box boy!\nI knew I heard something.\nSo you can talk!\nI can talk. And now you'll start talking!\nWhere you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?\nI don't understand.\nI thought we were friends.\nThe last thing we want to do is upset bees!\nYou're too late! It's ours now!\nYou, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!\nYou, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!\nWhere is the honey coming from? Tell me where!\nHoney Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!\nCrazy person!\nWhat horrible thing has happened here?\nThese faces, they never knew what hit them. And now\nthey're on the road to nowhere!\nJust keep still.\nWhat? You're not dead?\nDo I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?\nTo Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.\nI'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!\nI'm going to Tacoma.\nAnd you?\nHe really is dead.\nAll right.\nUh-oh!\nWhat is that?!\nOh, no!\nA wiper! Triple blade!\nTriple blade?\nJump on! It's your only chance, bee!\nWhy does everything have\nto be so doggone clean?!\nHow much do you people need to see?!\nOpen your eyes!\nStick your head out the window!\nFrom NPR News in Washington,\nI'm Carl Kasell.\nBut don't kill no more bugs!\nBee!\nMoose blood guy!!\nYou hear something?\nLike what?\nLike tiny screaming.\nTurn off the radio.\nWhassup, bee boy?\nHey, Blood.\nJust a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.\nWow!\nI assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.\nBees hang tight. We're all jammed in.\nIt's a close community.\nNot us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.\nWhat if you get in trouble?\nYou a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!\nAt least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.\nMosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.\nYou got to be kidding me!\nMooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!\nHey, guys!\nMooseblood!\nI knew I'd catch y'all down here.\nDid you bring your crazy straw?\nWe throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.\nWhat is this place?\nA bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.\nThey are pinheads!\nPinhead.\nCheck out the new smoker.\nOh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!\nSmoker?\nNinety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.\nThey make the honey, and we make the money.\n\"They make the honey, and we make the money\"?\nOh, my!\nWhat's going on? Are you OK?\nYeah. It doesn't last too long.\nDo you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?\nOur queen was moved here. We had no choice.\nThis is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!\nWhat is this?\nOh, no!\nThere's hundreds of them!\nBee honey.\nOur honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!\nThis is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.\nOh, Barry, stop.\nWho told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.\nDo these look like rumors?\nThat's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?\nHe's been talking to humans.\nWhat? Talking to humans?!\nHe has a human girlfriend. And they make out!\nMake out? Barry!\nWe do not.\nYou wish you could.\nWhose side are you on?\nThe bees!\nI dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.\nBarry, this is what you want to do with your life?\nI want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!\nDad, I remember you coming home so overworked\nyour hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.\nI remember that.\nWhat right do they have to our honey?\nWe live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!\nEven if it's true, what can one bee do?\nSting them where it really hurts.\nIn the face! The eye!\nThat would hurt.\nNo.\nUp the nose? That's a killer.\nThere's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.\nHive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.\nNo more bee beards!\nWith Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.\nGood evening. I'm Bob Bumble.\nAnd I'm Jeanette Ohung.\nA tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!\nTomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.\nTonight we're talking to Barry Benson.\nDid you ever think, \"I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this\"?\nBees have never been afraid to change the world.\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?\nWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\nWe were thinking of stickball or candy stores.\nHow old are you?\nThe bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.\nYou know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.\nIt's a common name. Next week...\nHe looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...\nNext week...\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.\nBear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.\nIn tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!\nIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\nHoney, her backhand's a joke!\nI'm not gonna take advantage of that?\nQuiet, please.\nActual work going on here.\nIs that that same bee?\nYes, it is!\nI'm helping him sue the human race.\nHello.\nHello, bee.\nThis is Ken.\nYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\nWhy does he talk again?\nListen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.\nBut it's our yogurt night!\nBye-bye.\nWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!\nYou poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!\nYes, and Adam here has been a huge help.\nFrosting...\nHow many sugars?\nJust one. I try not to use the competition.\nSo why are you helping me?\nBees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.\nThose are great, if you're three.\nAnd artificial flowers.\nOh, those just get me psychotic!\nYeah, me too.\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\nBees must hate those fake things!\nNothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.\nMaybe this could make up for it a little bit.\nThis lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\nI guess.\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\nAm I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty!\nIt's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\nI can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.\nYou think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?\nEverybody needs to stay behind the barricade.\nWhat's the matter?\nI don't know, I just got a chill.\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\nYou boys work on this?\nAll rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.\nAll right. Case number 4475,\nSuperior Court of New York,\nBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.\nMr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?\nA privilege.\nMr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?\nI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.\nMr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.\nI would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!\nTalking bee!\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?\nThey could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!\nMr. Benson?\nLadies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.\nUnfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!\nI wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!\nCall your first witness.\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.\nI suppose so.\nI see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!\nYes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.\nBeekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.\nI don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?\nNo.\nI couldn't hear you.\nNo.\nNo. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.\nThey're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\nYou mean like this?\nBears kill bees!\nHow'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?\nI was with a band called The Police.\nBut you've never been a police officer, have you?\nNo, I haven't.\nNo, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.\nOh, please.\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\nMr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.\nThank you. Thank you.\nI see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\nNot yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?\nWatch it, Benson! I could blow right now!\nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\nWhy doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!\nOrder in this court!\nYou're all thinking it!\nOrder! Order, I say!\nSay it!\nMr. Liotta, please sit down!\nI think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\nI'm a florist.\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\nTo a great team!\nWell, hello.\nKen!\nHello.\nI didn't think you were coming.\nNo, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\nOh, that was lucky.\nThere's a little left. I could heat it up.\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.\nThat's where I usually sit. Right... there.\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\nI know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.\nDo we?\nBees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.\nThat's just what I was thinking about doing.\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\nYeah, you do that.\nLook at that.\nYou know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.\nWhat's that?\nItalian Vogue.\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\nA lot of ads.\nRemember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!\nI love the smell of flowers.\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\nNot as much.\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\nKen, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!\nThis is pathetic!\nI've got issues!\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\nYou're bluffing.\nAm I?\nSurf's up, dude!\nPoo water!\nThat bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\nYou know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!\nWe need to talk! He's just a little bee!\nAnd he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!\nLong time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?\n No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\nMy nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!\nGoodbye, Ken.\nAnd for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!\nI'm sorry about all that.\nI know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!\nI always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\nAre you OK for the trial?\nI believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.\nWe would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\nGood idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...\nYeah.\nLayton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.\nDon't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.\nYou got the tweezers?\nAre you allergic?\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.\nWhat exactly is your relationship to that woman?\nWe're friends.\nGood friends?\nYes.\nHow good? Do you live together?\nWait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?\nI've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?\nYeah, but...\nSo those aren't your real parents!\nOh, Barry...\nYes, they are!\nHold me back!\nYou're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?\nHe's denouncing bees!\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\nObjection!\nI'm going to pincushion this guy!\nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\nOh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!\nOrder! Order!\nThe venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!\nAdam, stay with me.\nI can't feel my legs.\nWhat Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?\nI will have order in this court. Order! Order, please!\nThe case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed Turn Against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.\nHey, buddy.\nHey.\nIs there much pain?\nYeah.\nI... I blew the whole case, didn't I?\nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\nThey got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\nI can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!\nAll right.\nYou think it was all a trap?\nOf course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.\nWhat will the humans do to us if they win?\nI don't know.\nI hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.\nAdam, they check in, but they don't check out!\nOh, my.\nCould you get a nurse to close that window?\nWhy?\nThe smoke.\nBees don't smoke.\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\nBees don't smoke!\nBut some bees are smoking.\nThat's it! That's our case!\nIt is? It's not over?\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\nGet back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\nMr. Flayman.\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\nWhere is the rest of your team?\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.\nI actually heard a funny story about...\nYour Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?\nThey have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.\nI move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\nWhere is your proof?\nWhere is the evidence?\nShow me the smoking gun!\nHold it, Your Honor!\nYou want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.\nWhat is that?\nIt's a bee smoker!\nWhat, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.\nLook at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?\nWhat are we gonna do?\nHe's playing the species card.\nLadies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!\nFree the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees!\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\nVanessa, we won!\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\nSorry.\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\nAll the honey will finally belong to the bees.\nNow we won't have to work so hard all the time.\nThis is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.\nYou'll regret this.\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\nAll right. One at a time.\nBarry, who are you wearing?\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.\nWhat if Montgomery's right?\nWhat do you mean?\nWe've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.\nCongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.\nThen we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.\nWe demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.\nWe're all aware of what they do in the woods.\nWait for my signal. Take him out.\nHe'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.\nAnd we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.\nCan't breathe.\nBring it in, boys!\nHold it right there! Good.\nTap it.\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups and there's gallons more coming!\nI think we need to shut down!\nShut down? We've never shut down.\nShut down honey production!\nStop making honey!\nTurn your key, sir!\nWhat do we do now?\nCannonball!\nWe're shutting honey production!\nMission abort.\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\nReturning to base.\nAdam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.\nOh, yeah?\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\nAre they out celebrating?\nThey're home.\nThey don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.\nI heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.\nAt least we got our honey back.\nSometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?\nIt's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.\nThis was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now...\nNow I can't.\nI don't understand why they're not happy.\nI thought their lives would be better!\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\nHoney really changes people.\nYou don't have any idea what's going on, do you?\nWhat did you want to show me?\nThis.\nWhat happened here?\nThat is not the half of it.\nOh, no. Oh, my.\nThey're all wilting.\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\nNo.\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\nBees?\nSpecifically, me.\nI didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.\nIt's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\nTake away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.\nAnd then, of course...\nThe human species?\nSo if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?\nI know this is also partly my fault.\nHow about a suicide pact?\nHow do we do it?\nI'll sting you, you step on me.\nThat just kills you twice.\nRight, right.\nListen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\nVanessa?\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\nWhere are you going?\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.\nThey've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.\nIt's the Last Chance I'll ever have to see it.\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\nI know. Me neither.\nTournament of Roses.\nRoses can't do sports.\nWait a minute. Roses. Roses?\nRoses!\nVanessa!\nRoses?!\nBarry?\nRoses are flowers!\nYes, they are.\nFlowers, bees, pollen!\nI know.\nThat's why this is the last parade.\nMaybe not.\nCould you ask him to slow down?\nCould you slow down?\nBarry!\nOK, I made a huge mistake.\nThis is a total disaster, all my fault.\nYes, it kind of is.\nI've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.\nActually, it's completely closed down.\nI thought maybe you were remodeling.\nBut I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.\nI don't want to hear it!\nAll right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.\nI know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.\nAll we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.\nBees.\nPark.\nPollen!\nFlowers.\nRepollination!\nAcross the nation!\nTournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.\nThey've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.\nSecurity will be tight.\nI have an idea.\nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\nOfficial floral business. It's real.\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\nThank you. It was a gift.\nOnce inside, we just pick the right float.\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\nI could be the princess, and you could be the pea!\nYes, I got it.\nWhere should I sit?\nWhat are you?\nI believe I'm the pea.\nThe pea?\nIt goes under the mattresses.\nNot in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\nI'm getting the marshal.\nYou do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\nHey, what are you doing?!\nThen all we do is blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion.\nOnce at the airport, there's no stopping us.\nStop! Security.\nYou and your insect pack your float?\nYes.\nHas it been in your possession the entire time?\nWould you remove your shoes?\nRemove your stinger.\nIt's part of me.\nI know. Just having some fun.\nEnjoy your flight.\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.\nCan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!\nI think this is gonna work.\nIt's got to work.\nAttention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.\nBarry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.\nI gotta get up there and talk to them.\nBe careful.\nCan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\nCaptain, I'm in a real situation.\nWhat'd you say, Hal?\nNothing.\nBee!\nDon't freak out! My entire species...\nWhat are you doing?\nWait a minute! I'm an attorney!\nWho's an attorney?\nDon't move.\nOh, Barry.\nGood afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry!\nWhat happened here?\nThere was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.\nOne's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!\nIs that another bee joke?\nNo!\nNo one's flying the plane!\nThis is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?\nThis is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.\nWhere's the pilot?\nHe's unconscious, and so is the copilot.\nNot good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?\nAs a matter of fact, there is.\nWho's that?\nBarry Benson.\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\nVanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\nI can't fly a plane.\nWhy not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\nYes.\nHow hard could it be?\nWait, Barry!\nWe're headed into some lightning.\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.\nBarry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...\nThat's Barry!\n...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.\nFlowers?!\nWe have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.\nJust a minute. There's a bee on that plane.\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.\nThey've done enough damage.\nBut isn't he your only hope?\nTechnically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.\nTheir wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times?\n\"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\"\nGet this on the air!\nGot it.\nStand by.\nWe're going live.\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.\nBut let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.\nMore than we realized. To us, to everyone.\nThat's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.\nWe get behind a fellow.\nBlack and yellow!\nHello!\nLeft, right, down, hover.\nHover?\nForget hover.\nThis isn't so hard.\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\nBarry, what happened?!\nWait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.\nThat may have been helping me.\nAnd now we're not!\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\nAll of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!\nMove out!\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!\nDon't have to yell.\nI'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.\nIt's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\nI can't do this!\nVanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!\nYou snap out of it.\nYou snap out of it.\nYou snap out of it!\nYou snap out of it!\nYou snap out of it!\nYou snap out of it!\nYou snap out of it!\nYou snap out of it!\nHold it!\nWhy? Come on, it's my turn.\nHow is the plane flying?\nI don't know.\nHello?\nBenson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?\nThe Pollen Jocks!\nThey do get behind a fellow.\nBlack and yellow.\nHello.\nAll right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.\nWhere? I can't see anything. Can you?\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\nCome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\nThinking bee.\nThinking bee.\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\nWait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.\nWhat?\nI don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\nBring the nose down.\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\nWhat in the world is on the tarmac?\nGet some lights on that!\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\nVanessa, aim for the flower.\nOK.\nCut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?\nAffirmative!\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\nLand on that flower!\nReady? Full reverse!\nSpin it around!\nNot that flower! The other one!\nWhich one?\nThat flower.\nI'm aiming at the flower!\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\nI mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees!\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\nRotate around it.\nThis is insane, Barry!\nThis's the only way I know how to fly.\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\nAim for the center!\nNow drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\nCome on, already.\nBarry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!\nYes. No high-five!\nRight.\nBarry, it worked!\nDid you see the giant flower?\nWhat giant flower? Where? Of course\nI saw the flower! That was genius!\nThank you.\nBut we're not done yet.\nListen, everyone!\nThis runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.\nThat means this is our Last Chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.\nIf we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?\nAre we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?\nWe're bees!\nKeychain!\nThen follow me! Except Keychain.\nHold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this.\nYeah!\nI'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.\nOh, yeah.\nThat's our Barry.\nMom! The bees are back!\nIf anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!\nHere's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?\nWould you like some honey with that?\nIt is bee-approved. Don't forget these.\nMilk, cream, cheese, it's all me.  And I don't see a nickel!\nSometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!\nI had no idea.\nBarry, I'm sorry.\nHave you got a moment?\nWould you excuse me?\nMy mosquito associate will help you.\nSorry I'm late.\nHe's a lawyer too?\nI was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.\nHave a great afternoon!\nBarry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.\nNo problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.\nYou're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?\nAll right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.\nThank you, Barry!\nThat bee is living my life!\nLet it go, Kenny.\nWhen will this nightmare end?!\nLet it all go.\nBeautiful day to fly.\nSure is.\nBetween you and me,\nI was dying to get out of that office.\nYou have got to start thinking bee, my friend.\nThinking bee!\nMe?\nHold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?\nI'm not making a major life decision during a production number!\nAll right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.\nI had virtually no rehearsal for that.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Sports Betting Contracts\n\nThis project contains smart contract definitions for a decentralized sports betting application, among library code, deployment scripts and tests. The Sports Betting contract suite contains all contract functions necessary to allow addresses to stake and unstake ERC-20 tokens on sports matches (referred to here as 'fixtures') and claim winnings or refunds depending on the fixture result. The fixture result is denoted as H Fixtures are represented by their 'fixtureID' as defined by an external API and have an internal state which determines eligibility for e.g. staking on the fixture. The SportsOracleConsumer defines functions for the Sports Betting contract to interact with the external sports API via a decentralized oracle, which allows the contract to retrieve fixture kickoff time and result.\n\n# How to deploy\n\nYou can deploy the code via hardhat-deploy to a given network via\n\n```\nnpx hardhat --network <network>\n```\n\nThe corresponding front-end repo depends on a reference to the deployment information, which can be exported to the repo on the same level as sports-betting-dapp at the time of deployment. The following is an example when deploying to Goerli.\n\n```\nnpx hardhat --network goerli deploy --export ../sports-betting-ui/sports-betting-ui/src/deployments.json\n```\n\n# SportsBetting.sol\n\nThis contract contains the major public functions for interacting with the dApp via staking/unstaking ERC-20 tokens. It also contains the business logic that determines a particular user's entitlement for claiming a certain amount of staked ERC-20 tokens as winnings or refunds depending on the fixture result. \n\nThe fixture betting workflow is co-ordinated via the fixture's BettingState, which is an internal state representing the fixture. Fixture state transitions occur due to changes in time, e.g. the kick-off time approaches, or changes in API response, such as the fixture result becoming retrievable and therefore allowing payouts to occur. The fixture states are summarized below:\n- CLOSED\n\n  The default state of a fixture. In the CLOSED state, the fixture result cannot be staked on. \n  The state transition OPENING->CLOSED occurs if the contract receives a fixture kickoff time for the fixture which is too far ahead in the future relative to block timestamp, e.g. 1 week. \n- OPENING\n\n  The state transition CLOSED->OPENING occurs when an oracle request to the sports API is made to retrieve the fixture kick-off time. \n- OPEN\n\n  The OPEN state defines a fixture eligible for addresses to stake/unstake ERC-20 tokens on a given result.\n  The state transition OPENING->OPEN occurs if the contract receives a fixture kickoff time that is in a certain time range relative to the block timestamp, e.g. block timestamp is not 1 week before the kickoff time and not within 90 minutes of it. \n- AWAITING\n\n  The AWAITING state defines a fixture that is no longer eligible for staking, but the contract has not yet received the fixture result so payouts are not possible.\n  The OPEN->AWAITING state transition occurs when the block timestamp becomes too close to the kick-off time, e.g. within 90 minutes of it. Note that this does not rely on automated functions but occurs if a stake action is taken on a fixture with such a time or if a public transition function is called.\n- PAYABLE\n\n  The PAYABLE state defines a fixture that has its result fulfilled, where the result is one of HOME, DRAW or AWAY. In this state, addresses can claim winnings or refunds where applicable.\n  \n  The AWAITING->PAYABLE state transition occurs if the contract receives a fixture result from the sports oracle for that fixture.\n- CANCELLED\n\n  The CANCELLED state defines a fixture that has its result fulfilled, where the result is CANCELLED. This result signifies that the fixture could not occur and ERC-20 tokens staked on any result for that fixture should be claimable by stakers.\n  \nWhen a fixture is OPEN, addresses can call stake or unstake with the corresponding fixture_id and stake/unstake quantities to perform the stake action. This can be done infinitely many times while the fixture is in this state. If the fixture eventually becomes PAYABLE or CANCELLED, addresses can call withdrawPayout which performs different actions depending on the fixture state. \n\nIf a fixture is PAYABLE and the user has an active stake on the winning result, the user will receive a quantity of ERC-20 tokens that represents their share of all stakes made on all results for that fixture. The amount a winning staker is owed is calculated via the SportsBettingLib library function calculateStakerObligation and is equivalent to ((totalAmount/winningAmount)*stakerAmount) where totalAmount is the total amount bet on all results for that fixture, winningAmount is the total amount bet on the correct result for that fixture, and stakerAmount is the amount bet by the staker on the winning result for that fixture.\n\nIf a fixture is CANCELLED, the user can call withdrawPayout to receive a refund for all of their stakes on that fixture.\n\n# Fixture Result\n\nThe SportsBettingLib.FixtureResult enum defines the possible valid fixture outcomes.\n\n- DEFAULT\n- CANCELLED\n- HOME\n- DRAW\n- AWAY\n\nDEFAULT is a placeholder value which is used to prevent cases in which a fulfilled oracle result equal to zero is conflated with a failed oracle request fulfillment, in which the failed response may be the default uint256 value (zero). Therefore, if the contract receives a fixture result equal to zero, it is invalid and doesn't proceed.\n\nCANCELLED is used to denote a fixture that did not occur or does not have a meaningful result. Per the workflow above, this result will change the state of the fixture to CANCELLED and allow addresses to withdraw their original stakes.\n\nHOME, DRAW, AWAY represent the valid outcomes of a complete sports fixture. In these cases, per the workflow above, the state of the fixture will become PAYABLE and addresses that bet on the winning outcome can withdraw winnings.\n\nNOTE: SportsBettingLib.FixtureResult is also the parameter for the stake and unstake functions that allow the address to stake/unstake on fixtures, where the parameter determines the result that the address is staking/unstaking on. Here, only HOME, DRAW and AWAY are valid values to bet on.\n\n# SportsOracleConsumer.sol\n\nSportsOracleConsumer contract defines the necessary functions for interaction with the external sports API via a decentralized Chainlink oracle. The SportsBetting workflow depends on external data for two purposes: retrieving fixture kickoff time, and retrieving fixture results.\n\n- Requesting fixture kickoff time\n\nSportsOracleConsumer exposes a function requestFixtureKickoffTimeParameter which inititates a Chainlink request to retrieve the kickoff time for the fixture with argument fixture_id. The contract defines a virtual function fulfillFixtureKickoffTime which is called with a bytes32 requestId and uint256 representing the kickoff time in UNIX timestamp format.\n\n- Requesting fixture result\n\nSportsOracleConsumer exposes a function requestFixtureResultParameter which inititates a Chainlink request to retrieve the result for the fixture with argument fixture_id. The contract defines a virtual function fulfillFixtureResult which is called with a bytes32 requestId and uint256 representing the result. The SportsBettingLib function getFixtureResultFromAPIResponse is used to interpret the uint256 response as SportsBettingLib.FixtureResult type (see the above section).\n\n# Tests\n\nA Foundry test suite is contained in test/foundry directory. The suite contains\n\n- SportsBetting.t.sol\n\nUnit tests for all points in the fixture staking workflow.\n\n- SportsBettingInvariant.t.sol\n\nInvariant tests asserting global contract state variables remain logically consistent throughout the fixture staking workflow\n"

My name is Michelle and this is the portfolio project that I'm creating during my studies at [Codaisseur](https://github.com/Codaisseur). It's a sports betting app, specially made for my brother. It's purely for entertainment purposes for him and his friends during the Eredivisie league. The fun part is, I don't even like football/ soccer (don't want to start a discussion on the correct terminology of the sport :v:), I just love my brother (and I like to build apps).\n\n## THE APP :soccer:\n\nThe Sports betting app is an MVP, not a final version. The beginning of the web app is there, but there is so much more on my wishlist. Take a look at my [projectboard](https://github.com/users/mipes4/projects/1) to know what is going to be done in the future.\n\nAs a user of the Sports betting app you can create predictions on the matches in the upcoming rounds of the Eredivisie and earn points with (partially) right predictions. There is a winner per round and a winner of the entire season if a player opted in for the 'Totaaltoto'.\n\n- [Projectboard](https://github.com/users/mipes4/projects/1)\n- [Wireframe](https://sportsbetting-mp.netlify.app/)\n- [Back End Repo](https://github.com/mipes4/sportsbetting_be)\n\n## GOALS :goal_net:\n\n- Practice full-stack development\n- Apply what I've learned so far\n- Explore some new territory on my own\n- Having an individual portfolio project that shows my technical abilities\n- Creating the app for a 'customer'\n  - Have an appointment to talk through the ideas\n  - Manage expectations\n  - Come up with a satisfying plan and wireframe\n  - Meet the expectations\n- Simulate working in the real world\n  - Plan a project and work with user stories and tasks\n  - Work with version controle like a pro\n\n## USER STORIES :bookmark_tabs:\n\n- As a user interested in football and Eredivisie I want to do my sports bets of the Eredivisie among frieds, so we can make the matches more fun to watch and maybe win a little money.\n- As a user of the sports betting web app I need to know the game rules so I know how to earn points and money.\n- As an admin user of the sports betting web app I need to set up user accounts for people who want to join so that I can be in charge of who can join the group and who not.\n- As a user who's willing to win I'd like to see the scoreboard of all users and total of points so I can compare my predictions and score with the other users.\n- As a user who'd like to stay up to date with one glance at a page I want to see a quick overview of the most important need to knows of our sports betting.\n- As a user with interests in football and Eredivisie I'd like to do my bettings on a stylish, responsive, intuitive website so I enjoy the sports betting even more.\n- As a user who wants to have fun among friends with our shared interest football I'd like to share my club preference so we can talk about that.\n- As a user who has a shared interest of football and Eredivisie I'd like to chat with my friends about it.\n- As a user who wants to join this Sports betting group of friends for multiple seasons I would like to have a history of the Eredivisie league with bets and scores that I can look into.\n\n## TECHNOLOGIES :hammer_and_wrench:\n\n**Front End**\n\n- Node.js\n- React\n- Redux\n- Axios\n- Moment\n- React-Bootstrap\n- Bootswatch\n- SCSS\n\n**Back End**\n\n- Express\n- Axios\n- REST\n- Sequelize\n- Postgres\n- Middleware\n\n## :sparkles::sparkles: DEMO :sparkles::sparkles:\n\n![Demo of Sports betting app](Demo/demo_app.gif)\n\n## SETUP :electric_plug:\n\nThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\n\n**Look for the server side of this project at the [Back End repo](https://github.com/mipes4/sportsbetting_be)**\n\n### Available Scripts\n\nIn the project directory, you can run:\n\n#### `npm start`\n\nRuns the app in the development mode.<br />\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload if you make edits.<br />\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.\n\n#### `npm test`\n\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />\nSee the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.\n\n#### `npm run build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />\nYour app is ready to be deployed!\n\nSee the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.\n\n#### `npm run eject`\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can\u2019t go back!**\n\nIf you aren\u2019t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\u2019re on your own.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\u2019t be useful if you couldn\u2019t customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n#### `npm run build` fails to minify\n\nThis section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify\n"

The model fetches game data from The Odds API, which aggregates data from reputable sportsbooks such as Fanduel, DraftKings, and Barstool.\n\nThe model considers several key performance metrics that reflect a team's past performance in the current 2023 season such as:\n> R: Runs,\n\n> H: Hits,\n  \n> R/G: Runs per Game,\n  \n> OPS: On-base Plus Slugging,\n  \nand more.\n\nBy comparing these metrics with the latest betting lines offered, the model can predict which spreads are most likely to be successful.\n\n## Example Email\n\n![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43586291/235729092-86301d2e-3ccc-4912-9ad3-c3c22c88258b.png)\n\n## Technologies Used\n- Python\n- Pandas\n- NumPy\n- Scikit-learn\n- HTML\n- CSS\n- Gmail API\n- The Odds API\n\n## How to Use\n1. Create an account with [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) to get an API key. The API key is then used as an argument to the `fetch_data_from_api()` function in the script.\n\n2. Obtain credentials for Gmail API. These credentials should be stored in a `credentials.json` file in the root directory of the project. Read more on setting up the Gmail API with Python [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python)\n\n3. Replace ```msg[\"To\"] = \"YOUR_EMAIL_HERE\"``` on line 247 with the email you want to receive the recommendations to.\n\n4. Once the above prerequisites are completed, you can run the `main()` function to fetch the betting lines, generate recommendations, and send an email with the recommendations to a specified recipient.\n\n## Contribute\nEveryone is welcome to contribute to this project!

  "language": "TypeScript",
  "readme_contents": "# SportX Subgraph\n\nA SportX subgraph for [The Graph](https://thegraph.com). SportX provides a platform for sports betting on Ethereum.\n\n\n## Brief Description of The Graph Node Setup\n\nA Graph Node can run multiple subgraphs, and in this case it can have a subgraph for Ropsten, Mainnet and Kovan. The subgraph ingests event data by calling to Infura through http. It can also connect to any geth node or parity node that accepts RPC calls. Fast synced geth nodes work. To use parity, the `--no-warp` flag must be used. Setting up a local Ethereum node is more reliable and faster, but Infura is the easiest way to get started. \n\nThis subgraph has three types of files which tell the Graph Node to ingest events from specific contracts. They are:\n* The subgraph manifest (subgraph.yaml)\n* A GraphQL schema      (schema.graphql)\n* Mapping scripts       (ExchangeV1.ts, ExchangeV2.ts) \n\nThis repository has these files created and ready to compile, so a user can start this subgraph on their own. The only thing that needs to be edited is the contract addresses in the `subgraph.yaml` file to change between Kovan, Ropsten or Mainnet.  \n\nWe have provided a quick guide on how to start up the SportX-Subgraph graph node. If these steps aren't descriptive enough, the [getting started guide](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) has in depth details on running a subgraph.\n\n## Steps to Deploy The SportX Subgraph Locally \n  1. Install IPFS and run `ipfs init` followed by `ipfs daemon`\n  2. Install PostgreSQL and run `initdb -D .postgres` followed by `pg_ctl -D .postgres start` and `createdb graph-node-mainnet` (note this db name is used in the commands below for the mainnet examples)\n  3. If using Ubuntu, you may need to install additional packages: `sudo apt-get install -y clang libpq-dev libssl-dev pkg-config`\n  4. Clone this repository, and run the following:\n     * `yarn`\n     * `yarn codegen` \n  5. Clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node from master and `cargo build` (this might take a while)\n  6. a) Now that all the dependencies are running, you can run the following command to connect to Infura Mainnet (it may take a few minutes for Rust to compile). Password might be optional, it depends on your postrgres setup:\n\n```\n  cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \\\n  --postgres-url postgresql://USERNAME:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node-mainnet \\\n  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001 \\\n  --ethereum-rpc mainnet-infura:https://mainnet.infura.io --debug\n```\n  6. b) Or Mainnet with a Local Ethereum node. This is very common if you are working with brand new contracts, and you have deployed them to a testnet environment like *ganache* (note that ganache commonly uses port 9545 rather than 8545):\n```\n  cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \\\n  --postgres-url postgresql://USERNAME:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node-mainnet \\\n  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001 \\\n  --ethereum-rpc mainnet-local:http://127.0.0.1:8545 \n```\n  6. c) Or Infura Kovan _(NOTE: Infura Kovan is not reliable right now, we get inconsistent results returned. If Kovan data is needed, it is suggested to run your own Kovan node)_\n```\n    cargo run -p graph-node --release --   \\\n    --postgres-url postgresql://USERNAME:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node-testnet \\\n    --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001\n    --ethereum-rpc kovan-infura:https://kovan.infura.io \n\n```\n 6. d) Or a Kovan local node which was started with `parity --chain=kovan --no-warp  --jsonrpc-apis=\"all\" `:\n \n ```\n   cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \\\n   --postgres-url postgresql://USERNAME:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node-testnet \\\n   --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001 \\\n   --ethereum-rpc kovan-local:http://127.0.0.1:8545\n \n ```\n \n 6. e) You can also connect to ropsten, just follow the syntax that was used with the kovan example. \n \n 7. Now create the subgraph locally on The Graph Node with `yarn create-local`. On The Graph Hosted service, creating the subgraph is done in the web broswer. \n  \n 8. Now deploy the SportX subgraph to The Graph Node with `yarn deploy --debug`. You should see a lot of blocks being skipped in the `graph-node` terminal, and then it will start ingesting events from the moment the contracts were uploaded to the network. \n\nNow that you have subgraph is running you may open a [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) browser at `127.0.0.1:8000` and get started with querying.\n\n## Viewing the Subgraph on the Graph Hosted Service\nThis subgraph is not yet on [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). To understand how deploying to the hosted service works, check out the [Deploying Instructions](https://thegraph.com/docs/deploy-a-subgraph) in the official documentation. The most important part of deploying to the hosted service is ensuring that the npm script for `deploy` is updated to the correct name that you want to deploy with.\n\n## Getting started with Querying \n\nBelow are a few ways to show how to query the SportX-Subgraph for data. \n\n### Querying all possible data that is being stored\nThe query below shows all the information that is possible to query, but is limited to the first 5 instances. There are many other filtering options that can be used, just check out the [querying api](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/graphql-api.md).\n\n```\n{\n  orders(first: 5){\n    id\n    maker\n    market {\n        id\n        baseToken\n        title\n        outcomeOne\n        outcomeTwo\n        outcomeVoid\n        referenceUrl\n        registered      \n    }\n    taker\n    newFilledAmount\n    totalBetSize\n    percentageOdds\n    expiry\n    oracleFee\n    relayerMakerFee\n    relayerTakerFee\n    salt\n    relayer\n    isMakerBettingOutcomeOne\n    takerAmount\n    takerEscrow\n    potSize\n    makerOracleFee\n    takerOracleFee      \n  }\n}\n\n```\nThe command above can be copy pasted into the Graphiql interface in your browser at `127.0.0.1:8000` or in the query playground on the hosted-service."

  "readme_contents": "# Getting Started with CAM Sportsbook\n\n## Where to Use the Sportsbook\n\nSimply click on the following link: [https://24juice22.github.io/cam-sportsbook/](https://24juice22.github.io/cam-sportsbook/)\n\n## How to Make Bets\n\nIf you are familiar with betting at online sportsbooks such as BetMGM or FanDuel then you already know how to navigate this app. CAM Sportsbook is modeled after the top online sprotsbooks in the industry. However, if you are new to the betting world then please keep reading.\n\n### `Choosing a Sport`\n\nUse the navigation menu to choose which sport you would like to bet on, unless you wish to bet on the sport that is displayed on the homepage. You have the option of the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, NCAAF (College Football), or NCAAB (College Basketball). Once you have chosen your sport you will then be presented with a list of games to bet on.\n\n### `Wager Types`\n\n![Sportsbook Screenshot](./src/images/readMe/wager-type.png)\n\nFor each game, you will have at most 3 wager types that you can make. (Note: some wager types may not have data provided yet from the api and will appear blank for the time being). The wager types are as follows:\n\n- Spread\n\n  > **Indicates the expected result of the game. From the screenshot above, the Carolina Panthers (+5.5) are expected to lose by 5.5 points. By choosing this wager, you are betting that they lose by less than this amount (or possibly even win). The Atlanta Falcons (-5.5) are expected to win by 5.5 points. By choosing the falcons, you are betting that they will win by more than 5.5 points**\n\n- Total\n\n  > **Indicates the expected combined points scored by both teams. Using the screenshot (O 45.5) means that you are betting for the two teams to combine for Over 45.5 points scored. (U 45.5) means you are betting for the teams to score Under 45.5 points.**\n\n- Moneyline\n  > **Indicates which team you think will win the game. The margin of victory does not matter**\n\n### `Wager Price`\n\nFor each wager type there appears a blue number which represents the wager price and is either positive or negative.\n\n- Negative\n\n  > **A negative wager price indicates that you must bet that amount in order to win $100. For instance, a price of (-105) means that for every $105 you bet, you would win $100. However, if you lose, then you lose the full $105.**\n\n- Positive\n  > **A positive wager price indicates that for every $100 that you bet, you will win that amount. For example if the price is (+250) then for every $100 you bet you will win $250. However, if you lose then you only lose the $100.**\n\nLets look at the screenshot to go over some example wagers:\n\n- The green box above (which is the color a box will turn when you choose to make that bet) says +5.5 in black and -120 in blue and is next to the Carolina Panthers. Therefore, you are betting that the Panthers don't lose by 6 or more points and for every $120 you bet you can win $100. So if you choose this box and bet $60 and the Panthers lose by 3 points, you will win $50. This is because you are paid .833 (100/120) times what you bet.\n\n- If you choose the box on the top right (Moneyline) that says +370 in blue and is next to the Carolina Panthers then you are betting that the Panthers will win the game and you will be paid $370 for every $100 that you bet. Therefore, if you bet $60 and the Panthers win you will win $222. This is because you are paid 3.7 (370/100) times what you bet.\n\n### `Making a Wager`\n\nTo make a wager, simply click on the box that represents the bet you would like to make. For instance the green box in the previous screenshot. Once you click on a box it will become green and the information will be added to your \"Betslip\". If you click the box again, it will no longer be filled green and will be removed from your \"Betslip\".\n\nSo what is the Betslip?\n\n> **The Betslip is the page (on small screens) or right section of the page (on larger screens) where all of your prospective bets (also known as slips) are stored and await for you to input how much you wish to wager. See the mobile screenshot below:**\n\n![Betslip Screenshot](./src/images/readMe/betslip.png)\n\nIn the above betslip there are 2 slips. The top one represents a Moneyline bet on the Washington Commanders at a price of +130. In this slip, the user entered $120 into the form input as the bet amount. Below that amount it says $156 in blue and that is what will be won if they make the bet. The second slip represents a Total bet on the Over 44.5 points and has a price of -105. The user entered a wager of $200 and could possibly win $190.48.\n\nIn the above screenshot the user is not logged in and must first do so in order to make a bet. However, if they were logged in, the button at the bottom of the page would say \"Bet\". Clicking the Bet button would result in a popup asking you to confirm your wager.\n\nHow do I get to the Betslip?\n\n> **On Mobile or Tablet simply click on the Betslip link on the betbar (bottom navigation). This is highlighted in the above screenshot. If on larger screens the betslip will always be visible on the right side of the screen**\n\n### `Setting Up Your Account`\n\nIn order to make a bet you must be logged in to your account and have enough money in your account for a wager. Use the following steps to complete this process:\n\n1. Click the \"JOIN NOW\" button on the navbar and fill out the popup form, including a username and password.\n2. Click the \"Login\" button on the navbar and fill in your username and password.\n3. Click the now visible \"Deposit\" button on the navbar. Input a dollar amount less than $10,000 to deposit into your account.\n4. Make your wagers as previously outlined in this README document.\n\n### `View My Account Information`\n\nTo view your account information, click on the account link on the betbar. You will be taken to the account page which will display your name, bankroll, and any bets you have previously made.\n"

[Here](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet) are some instructions from Harmony that can get you started.\n\n## About\nContract address: [0x8d3f00cabc107d969b09aac7373fced190f42510](https://explorer.pops.one/address/0x8d3f00cabc107d969b09aac7373fced190f42510)\n\nA project for the [Harmony University Hackathon](https://taikai.network/en/harmonyprotocol/hackathons/hackthefuture/overview).\n\nMade with \u2764 by Jeremy ([@jeremyzhang01](https://twitter.com/jeremyzhang01)), Albert ([@AlbertWZhang](https://twitter.com/AlbertWZhang)), Charles ([@charlesma_20](https://twitter.com/charlesma_20)), and Ash ([@ashlan_ahmed](https://twitter.com/ashlan_ahmed))\n\n## Testnet Deployment Setup\nFirst, create a file called `.env` to store the mnemonic.\n\nThen, run the command `npx mnemonic` in the terminal to generate a mnemonic. Copy and paste this into `.env`, so that it now has one line in the form\n```\nMNEMONIC = 'a lot of words go here'\n```\nThen, you want to figure out what the wallet addresses are based on your given mnemonic. To do so, run `truffle console --network harmony_testnet`\n\nOnce the truffle development console prompt displays, run `accounts`, which will display a list of accounts. Make note of the first account, and the fact that it begins with `0x`. Take this account address and put it in the search bar [here](https://explorer.pops.one/) to get the equivalent Harmony ONE address, which begins with `one1`. Go to the Harmony ONE faucet [here](https://faucet.pops.one/) and paste in the Harmony ONE address and request test tokens.\n\nNow that your account has test tokens, you can deploy the smart contracts. To deploy the smart contracts, run `truffle migrate --reset --network harmony_testnet`\n\nThis project uses [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/)\n\nThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\n"
